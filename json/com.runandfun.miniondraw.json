It is Illumination Entertainment's first film. It was directed by Pierre Coffin and Chris Renaud, based on an original story by Sergio Pablos.The film stars the voice of Steve Carell as Gru, a super-villain who adopts three girls (the voices of Miranda Cosgrove, Dana Gaier, and Elsie Fisher) from an orphanage; and the voice of Jason Segel as Vector, a rival of Gru who steals the Great Pyramid of Giza. When Gru learns of Vector's heist, he plans an even greater heist: to shrink and steal the Earth's moon.It was entirely animated by the French animation studio Mac Guff, which was later acquired by Illumination Entertainment.[2]The film earned positive reviews from critics, and grossed over $543 million worldwide, against a budget of $69 million.[1] A sequel, Despicable Me 2, released on July 3, 2013, is to be followed by a spin-off featuring Gru's Minions as the main characters on December 19, 2014.[3]",
