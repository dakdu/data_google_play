    "description": "Customize you home screen with Dwight Howard Widget.About Dwight HowardHoward was born in Atlanta, Georgia, to Dwight, Sr. and Sheryl Howard, and into a family with strong athletic connections. His father is a Georgia State Trooper and serves as Athletic Director of Southwest Atlanta Christian Academy, a private academy with one of the best high school basketball programs in the country, while his mother played on the inaugural women's basketball team at Morris Brown College.[1] Howard's mother had seven miscarriages before he was born.[2] A devout Christian since his youth, Howard became serious about basketball around the age of nine; when in the eighth grade, he resolved to be selected as the number one pick in the NBA Draft one day.[3][4] Despite his large frame, Howard was quick and versatile enough to play the guard position.[4] He elected to attend Southwest Atlanta Christian Academy for high school, and in his four years he played mostly as power forward, averaging 16.6 points per game (ppg), 13.4 rebounds per game (rpg) and 6.3 blocks per game in 129 appearances.[1][4] As a senior, Howard led his team to the 2004 state title.[4] He averaged 25 points, 18 rebounds, 8.1 blocks and 3.5 assists per game.[4] That same year, Howard was widely recognized as the best American high school basketball player, and he was awarded the Naismith Prep Player of the Year Award, the Morgan Wootten High School Player of the Year Award, Gatorade National Player of the Year and the McDonald's National High School Player of the Year honor.[5] He was also co-MVP (with J. R. Smith) of the McDonald's High School All-American Game that year.[5] On January 31, 2012, Howard was also honored as one of the 35 greatest McDonald's All-Americans.[6]Following his high school successes, Howard chose to forego college and declared for the 2004 NBA Draftâa decision partly inspired by his idol Kevin Garnett who had done the same in 1995âwhere the Orlando Magic selected him first overall over UConn junior Emeka Okafor.[1][4] He took the number 12 for his jersey, in part because it was the reverse of Garnett's 21 when he played for Minnesota.[7] Howard joined a depleted Magic squad that had finished with only 21 victories the previous season; further, the club had just lost perennial NBA All-Star Tracy McGrady.[4] Howard, however, made an immediate impact. He finished his rookie season with an average of 12.0 ppg and 10.0 rpg,[8] setting several NBA records in the process. He became the youngest player in NBA history to average a double double in the regular season.[5] He also became the youngest player in NBA history to average at least 10 rebounds in a season and youngest NBA player ever to record at least 20 rebounds in a game.[5] Howard's importance to the Magic was highlighted when he became the first player in NBA history directly out of high school to start all 82 games during his rookie season.[5] For his efforts, he was selected to play in the 2005 NBA Rookie Challenge, and was unanimously selected to the All-Rookie Team.[5] He also finished third to fellow center Emeka Okafor of the Charlotte Bobcats and guard Ben Gordon of the Chicago Bulls for the Rookie of the Year award.[9]INSTRUCTIONS:To add a widget, go to widgets menu, choose widget to add widget, hold and drag to empty space.* Legal / Credits: *The Comic book/Comic book name, images, characters, logo and other details are not created by us but by their respective owners.* Advertising *We include a monetization platform to keep this app 100% FREE*Ads Agreement.*Creating an app takes time and money, In order to keep creating great (and free!) apps, we are using a new search service to monetize our apps.
