Recently I have had an issue where when I change my profile (activate) it does not change the wallpaper as configured. If I activate the profile a second time it does change the wallpaper. I have remove the app, put it back, created new profiles, nothing changes this behaviour. If I can get an answer I will change to 5 stars and buy the paid version gladly.

I don\\'t even bother with the profile in Audio Manager Pro anymore, why bother when this app will do the same thing automatically! LOVE this app! My only complaint is I didn\\'t find it sooner!
