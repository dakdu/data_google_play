        "comment": "The app is a statistical package and faulted for the poor overview in Google Play.   You get more explicit information about that after you load the app and read the notice about what it does.  At the very end of the notice it tells you, paraphrasing, \\342\\200\\234the app does not collect actual data on its own and if you want that get some other app.   This one is not for you\\342\\200\\235.  From what I could tell the app will run stats from two sources, user hand entered, or side loaded/downloaded from Sleepbot.   You can hand qualify your input with tags related to dreams, aids (like alcohol, pills &etc.), hindrances (like caffeine, dog barking, bathroom break & etc.), tags (like hotel, school night, work night & etc.), and add notes and comments.  It will then run stats on the above.  No so useful for me but might be a replacement for doing your own monitoring with Excel.   It might be useful for evaluating Sleepbot data.  Given the developers comment of, \\342\\200\\234Go ahead and post whatever nonsense you want in the Android Market comments, but I\\'ve given up on reading them\\342\\200\\235, I doubt if they would be any good.  Cranks can be discounted but dismissing feeback is not a good developer strategy.",
