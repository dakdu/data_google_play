Add score leaderboards for a bit of competition 2. Pretty Please With A Cherry On Top - add line on top showing the progress of the current level (distance untill next one) and showing how far the FUEL is from you. Also remove ads popping out during the race, its annoying. Will give 5 stars if all is done.",
