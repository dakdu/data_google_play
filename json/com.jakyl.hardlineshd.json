Works exceptionally well on both small and big screens, with three different control mechanisms to ensure that you\\'re doing what you mean to be doing.  Simple enough that my three year-old can play it, fleshed out enough so that an adult can play, and play, and play again (and enjoy the very funny comments).  Get it.",

I only have a few complaints                       1) I was expecting there to be a tron lightcycle style mode. basically 1-8 lines, and the lines continually stretch. they never disappear. Anyone who has seen a tron movie or played armagetron advanced knows exactly what I am talking about                         2) A demo would be nice. I\\'m glad I did decide to buy it, but the decision would have been easier if I had gotten to play a timed game (maybe like 1-5 minutes) in the survival game mode beforehand.     otherwise, the game is great, fun, and worth every penny.",

Only down side is it needs to be able to switch screen around on a nexus 7 as I am right handed and keep swiping the google now toggle by mistake. Double annoying because there is no resume when you to to go back you have to load it again. Very annoying!!!  Apart from that it is very good. How about a modern retro version of bombjack?",
