This has nothing to do with this app. I have connected USB hub for my Android TV HDMI stick and tested whatever I had. USB flash drives from 4GB to 64GB all working. Micro SD cards 16GB and 32GB mounted per microSD to USB adapter - both working. Old laptop HD, some 100+GB per USB enclosure also works. WiFi USB wireless keyboard & mouse mounted as well. No more Microsoft OS pain for me! I am free, free at last :)",

It recognized the device but didn\\'t mount it both automatically and manually. Dev said 99% of the time its the cable that has the problem so I was set on ordering another one that same day. After I made the order, I digged around for an alternative app and landed on this one. I didn\\'t keep my hopes up, but to my surprise it recognized it and mounted it! I\\'m thinking of getting the pro version when I get extra cash for the automated mounting but hey its not really hassle to manually mount/unmount it. And yes, this post is quite long but I did it to make a point to check out this app before ordering another otg cable if it didn\\'t work with stickmount.",
