        "comment": "What could be this app\\'s best ally, the new Samsung Android Camera, is an utter failure. The system cannot keep up with the camera\\'s output, the zoom does not work at all on the zoom button and you get something like 3* zoom otherwise - but it won\\'t focus. Utter and complete failure.    If this worked I\\'d give it 5 stars - but it simply does not work.",

Also, I can\\'t even set an event and always shows as \\\"Could not create event. Please try again.\\\" I\\'m not really sure what\\'s happening but I\\'m quite disappointed. I can\\'t even browse for other events regardless what I type in. It\\'s very annoying that it prompts me to logout everytime. Can\\'t it always be online even if you exit the app? Look like I\\'m looking for an expensive Windows 8 tab with Wacom digitizer that can run Procaster instead of a Droid that runs this dud app.",
