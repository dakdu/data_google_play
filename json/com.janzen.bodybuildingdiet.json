I love how the diet changes depending on what you\\'re working on that day and the meal suggestions.   What I thought could use improvement was the scheduling. You should be able to list which days you\\'d like to take a break (Sunday for instance). Not everyone can be free to work out every day, especially when you have an active social life and weekends are more of a commodity",
