I have provided a option to low the screen brightness.On some devices the video is recorded or previewed with a 90Âº inversion. For example HTC DESIRE.When a videorecord starts or stops some devices make beeps. This is for legal reasons and  itÂ´s not possible to avoid. If your device is rooted you had better chances to mute it.",
