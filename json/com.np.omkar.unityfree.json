Often times I wait for a second or two before app launches not sure if the press registered.   Other than that though  good job!",

        "comment": "There are umpteen of these on Play now. Most only have preselected apps on the bar. Convenient but not \\\"multi-tasking.\\\" This on integrates contacts/dialing while others do not which is great. I have been using two: homeflip with contacts-notification. Difference: Recently run (and/or still resident) apps appear on the bar instead of or in addition to preselected favorites. Favorites can be added from recently runs quite easily. One can choose how many apps as well.  So with inclusion of homeflip\\'s recent apps functionality, this one would do the whole job.  BTW, this appears to be neither a launcher (trebuchet or stock is still there!) nor an overlay (such as homeflip), nor is it an accessibility-selected service. I like its seemless integration, wish others would follow suit!",
