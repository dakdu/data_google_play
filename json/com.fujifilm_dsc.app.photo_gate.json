The app even turns on your WiFi signal for you if you haven\\'t turned it on yet. Overall the app has a simple and clean interface, easy operation, and does the trick.",

        "comment": "[Updated review] My main use for the app is to supply the camera with GPS coordinates. The F800 EXR does not have on-board GPS (the previous F770 model had GPS though) but can get coordinates by wifi from a smartphone. The camera stores the downloaded GPS coordinates for max 3 hrs then forgets it. If exact location is critical for you, you need to download the coordinates to the camera from the phone each time you move to a new location. The app has very low  drain on battery,  it\\'s not noticeable. A feature is the ability to transfer photos by wifi to the cell phone (but why not take pics with the cell phone?). Feature request: periodic automatic download of GPS coordinates to camera, say every 5 or 10 minutes (user set-able).   Update: camera and phone need to be touching each other for reliable wifi connections, if not touching, connection takes many re-tries. The ideal camera has both wifi and GPS. Bump to 5 stars not that I understand \\\"bring devices close together\\\" means \\\"devices touching\\\". Camera acts as a very low power wifi hotspot that the camera connects.",
