That October, Kardashian filed for divorce following 72 days of marriage. The move garnered significant backlash from the media, who labeled it a \"publicity stunt\". After 536 days, Kardashian and Humphries reached an undisclosed settlement at the Los Angeles Superior Court, finalizing the divorce in April 2013.Kardashian was born in Los Angeles, California, the daughter of attorney Robert Kardashian and his wife Kris Kardashian (nÃ©e Houghton).
