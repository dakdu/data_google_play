Even has the capability to relaunch spotify when the desktop app inevitably spontaneously crashes!  Only suggestion would be to make the server app capable of updating itself or at least letting me know on the computer and not just my phone.",

Otherwise still works well, though I hope to see these issues fixed with the next few updates.",
