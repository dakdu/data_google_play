    "description": "Play and learn at the same time 3 different game modes * Alphabet* ABC memory* Learn to readThis game is also fun for the youngest children with a little help from an adult who reads the word and the child selects imageHave fun!Learn to Read is a fun, Android-based app that helps children learn the ABCsand begin to develop early reading skills, while enjoying a fun game. Our bright,friendly application was developed specifically with preschoolers in mind, ensuringthat their attention will be held by the colorful graphics. While they enjoy the funinterface, they will be learning about their letters and building those early skills thatwill lead to reading.Studies show that children learn best through play, particularly when it comes toskills that involve multiple senses. To learn to read, children must have the abilityto both visually recognize letters and then recall the sounds they make. The morechildren see letters and hear their corresponding sounds, the easier it becomesfor them to master their relationship. Repetition is key to mastering the ABCs, butunfortunately, most preschoolers have limited attention spans, particularly for non-preferred tasks that do not seem fun.As an educational game, Learn to Read makes it fun for kids to learn their ABCs.Children are naturally attracted to technology, particularly handheld electronics likeAndroid phones. Our interactive learning app features bright, colorful graphics andan easy-to-use interface that preschoolers are drawn to. The app also includes threefun, educational games in one to hold children's short attention spans for longerperiods of time.The three games found in Learn to Read each develop a different set of skills inyoung children through hands-on, fun learning that will feel just like play to them:- The Alphabet Sound Chart - With the Alphabet Sound Chart, children see a full listof all 26 letters in the English alphabet. Both the lowercase and uppercase versionsare shown for each letter, getting kids accustomed to viewing both formats. Eachset of letters is displayed in an individual block and is large enough for children toread with ease. As children touch the letter on the screen, they are treated with thesound that the letters make. Preschoolers quickly become captivated by discoveringthe effect that their fingers have on the screen and begin repeatedly pressing letters.Each time, they hear the proper pronunciation of the sound, strengthening theirmental connection between the letters and the sounds that they produce.- ABC Memory - The ABC Memory game not only builds letter recognition skills, butalso enhances children's ability to reason and recall. On the bottom of the screen,kids see a large, uppercase letter positioned below smaller white blocks. The objectof the game is to turn over the blocks and find the matching letters to make sets.Children are naturally curious and anxious to see what's hidden in each block,compelling them to continue playing and learning.- Learn to Read - The Learn to Read component of the game combines the letter andsound recognition skills built in Alphabet Sound Chart and ABC Memory to helpchildren begin to recognize common sight words. In this game, a word is shownwith four pictures above. Children are rewarded for selecting the picture thatcorresponds with the word.The Learn to Read app is the latest in smart, fun kids' games. Download it today foryour child to enjoy while on the go or at home and watch them build their readingskills while having fun.Tags: kids, children, ABC, English, learn, puzzle, letters, alphabet, read, ABCs, Reading, Educational,  Games, Preschool, Preschool-aged, alphabet memory , alphabet sound chart",
