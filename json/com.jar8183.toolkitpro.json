    "description": "Provides a useful interface for calculating unknown quantities in the fields of electronics and electrical engineering. Current features include:Resistor colour codes - tells you the resistance, tolerance, upper and lower values, and E-series information for any colour-coded resistor.Ohm's Law and Power Calculator - Finds any unknown quantity in terms of voltage, current, resistance and power dissipation for any omhic component.Series/Parallel Value Calculator. Finds the total value for any series or parallel combination of resistors, capacitors,  or inductors. The calculator can also find an individual value given the value for the whole combination.Reactance Finder - Calculates the reactance of any capacitor   or inductor from the circuit frequency.Power Triangle - Calculates real, apparent, and reactive power dissipation as well as impedance phase angle in any electrical system.Resistivity - Finds the resistance of any wire or prism from its dimensions and resistivity, or vice versa.Magnetic Fields - Finds the force that acts on a conductor in a magnetic field.Capacitors - Finds the charge and energy stored in a capacitor.ALL OF THE FEAURES OF THE FREE VERSION, PLUS:Amplifiers - Finds the voltage gain of an inverting or non-inverting operational amplifier circuit, as a ratio and in decibels.555 Astable/Monostable Circuits - Finds the output frequency, period, and duty cycle of the popular NE555 timer IC, for given component values. Resistivity Table - Lists the resistivity and temperature coefficient for 35 common materials.Capacitance - Finds the capacitance of two parallel plates separated by a dielectric.Permittivity Table - Lists the average dielectric constant for 35 common materials.Waveforms - Finds the peak, RMS, and mean voltages of some common AC waveforms.Resonance - Calculates the resonant frequency of a series RLC circuit, and the impedance at this frequency. Plots a graph of impedance against frequency.LED Resistors - Finds the minimum resistance needed to prevent damage to a number of LEDs in series. Also finds suitable E6, E12, and E24 series resistors.Star/Delta Resistors - Converts a star (Y) resistor configuration into the equivalent delta (Î) configuration, or vice versa.Capacitor Charging - Finds the voltage across a charging or discharging capacitor after a given time period.List of 4000 Series ICs - Details of common integrated circuits.Many more electrical utilities coming soon, with regular updates. Plus, NO ADS.Please rate or give feedback. Feel free to give suggestions or comments.",

        "comment": "Although quite good for the hobbyist or student proving his formulae, this doesn\\'t have the features that any professional might expect (and I am a professional designer). The trouble is that it returns the results from given values, whereas if you\\'re designing you would want to quickly establish required values for a desired outcome. Pulling  out the calculator therefore assumes you\\'re aware of the applicable formula, rendering this app largely irrelevant as a \\'pro\\' (ergo... \\'professional) tool.",

Don\\'t know if its due to the Android 4 update or not but developer should look into it.  Otherwise the app was great.  Update: as I said above my rating would change once the developer fixed the problem discussed above.  He was very prompt with answering my email, fixed the bug and released a update.  The app works great with no problems.  Thanks for a great app.",
