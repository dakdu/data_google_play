        "comment": "I downloaded this program because other players will only play mp3s or m4bs but not both, and a lot of my audio book files are one or the other, so this program will play both and I don\\'t have to have two different players installed to use depending on the file format of the book I want to listen to. The free streaming radio stations are just an added welcome bonus. ^_^  Thank you sincerely from a very satisfied customer!  ~Ami E. Bowen via an Acer Iconia a500.",
