        "comment": "I\\'ve been using Good Night, Android for a while now.  New features keep getting added. The latest version (2.7 at this time) supports disabling Bluetooth and Mobile Data as well as Wifi, Sound, Vibration, and Airplane mode.  When I\\'ve contacted the developer for stupid user issues (me!) he has responded quickly and been more than willing to help.  One of my must have apps.",
