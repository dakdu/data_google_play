        "comment": "I can definitely use this tool.  Suggestions: a field for tracking pitch and possibly free form notes; maybe even a field for the preferred manufacturer code and track number.   A toggle to display song title first, then artist would be helpful.  I like the sort options and the ability to mark favorites.  The stars will be helpful especially when the ability to add manufacturer\\'s  codes is available.",

I use it not only for my karaoke list but Im a singer and its handy that way as well. Bells id like to see, a way to capture a song like shazam, a way to capture lyrics would be nice. And when you add a song have the cursor in the field. Over all I LOVE IT. Super useful.",
