        "comment": "The app is great, easy to use and very comfortable, though you could add some features : Tag system that will give information about damage type (magic/physical/mixed) area of effect (single target/AoE) and amount of cc divided to soft and hard cc. Another great thing would be the addition of synergy list (champions who work well together such as orianna and malphite due to their ultimate combination)",
