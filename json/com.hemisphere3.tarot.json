What I find most resourceful is the breakdown of card description with keywords, card position, and detailed interpretation. Users can see what the symbols mean in a single card as well. I also love that I can access all cards to look up any card\\'s meaning, which isn\\'t usually available on other free version divination apps.",

Instead of carrying a book around with me everywhere, I just carry my deck in a small pouch since I always have my phone with me. It\\'s so convenient in case I forget what a card means. I love the encyclopedia so much.",

The thing with this app is, it\\'s crazy how it is in resonance and synchronicity with the expression of the moment..!  Yes, I know that it\\'s mostly my own energy creating / living the resonance, still, it is surprisingly just like drawing a card from a physical deck. Some decks are more \\'tuned\\' than others,  and this app is tuned :-)",
