    "description": "Python is a general-purpose, interpreted programming language whose design philosophy emphasizes code readability.  This application was created as a review of basic Python v2.7.3 programming terms, concepts, commands and history.  The intended audience is High School to Computer Science Undergraduate students, professionals refreshing their knowledge, and non-native English speakers trying to improve their English technical vocabulary.  This is meant to be a study aide and not an entertainment application. These applications were originally created for some students preparing for an exam.  The developer quickly realized that other people may be interested in reviewing their knowledge too.  Most questions are considered common knowledge and usually have been cross-referenced with at least two different sources.  Please send suggestions for improvement and other comments to Mark at m.r.droids2012@gmail.com  Thanks!Features:* Questions and possible answers are shuffled randomly* Play offline* Unlimited Play* No advertisements* No registration necessary* No device permissions requiredThis content is released under the Creative Commons 3.0 Attribution License available at:  http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/legalcodeKeywords:  free, trivia, game, quiz, test, certification, technical qualification, prep, CBIS, computer-based information system, Python, COSC, CS, computer science, IT, Information Technology, Sapere Aude!--Horace",
