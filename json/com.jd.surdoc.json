Wanted all of my SD card and flash memory backup. 100gb free, it shouldn\\'t be a problem, I have no idea why it had \\\"camera photos\\\" as with do much storage selecting folders by hand means I can ensure the right folder location is selected and additional photo folders are missed. I am surely not going in every folder and back up everything out of it\\'s original folders would be a mess and a waste of time. Also a auto it manual backup option will go a long way, I am very precious with my phone and tablet batteries. Also don\\'t want several \\\"mobile devices\\\" to be put together and be nice pick my own online backup folders (folder back up, select what to be auto backup instead of only camera photos, own free range where auto backup goes which will fix the concern of mobile devices mixing - regular backups mean not bombarded with huge data slowing server all at once) not even worried about the lack of tablet UI, as long it functions to the users needs, also wouldn\\'t mind ads if it keeps it free.. other than that, it\\'s free (but useless to quickly backup) and looks clean.",
