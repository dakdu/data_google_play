        "comment": "It is meant to be for children. I\\'d not advise this for children.  Parents, here what it does:  - Your are interrupted all the way when your children wants to draw - It\\'s really not just one message that pops up, a lot of them - It pops up \\\"app of the week\\\" message that is not optin and forces you to open Google Play, even if you don\\'t want to -  Every time with a pop up app and showing teasers at the end, children gets distracted and after a while.  Seems to me a very greedy app.",
