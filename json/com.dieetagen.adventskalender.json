    "description": "Discover the new generation of advent calendars!This innovative App connects the traditional advent calendar with the virtual world. So you can not only enjoy a piece of delicious Windel chocolate everyday, but also a fancy Santa animation on your Android smartphone and tablet.Behind each of the 24 doors thereâs a picture (marker) which can be read using this App. Each marker shows a different animation. And with a bit of entertainment the time until Christmas flies. By the way, behind all this is the technic of augmented reality.How it works: Open a calendar door every day, tear it off along the perforation and place it on a bright background. Make sure using the App with good lighting conditions. The App starts the camera of your device. Focus it with a distance of 20 cm on the marker and the Windel Santa will show up. Sometimes funny, sometimes clumsy, sometimes sporty. Get a little taste! Download the first marker here, print it and try it with this App.http://dl.die-etagen.de/Kundenupload/Windel/Windel_Marker_01.zipTo see all 24 animations you have to buy the Windel APP calendar. It is available in shops during the Christmas season 2012. For more information visitwww.die-etagen.de/windel-adventskalenderEnjoy and have a merry Christmas!Your Windel Christmas Team",

        "comment": "This is really clever.  Downloaded the marker & printed it off.  Struggled to get it to work on my hand, worked best on a white background.  They also had a picture demo on their website site so printed that & cut the marker out that was on her hand.  It worked & more interesting than the demo marker on android!",
