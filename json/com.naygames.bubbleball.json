If you think it\\'s too easy, challenge yourself to use as few pieces as possible in each level, or to get the ball to the flag as fast as possible, or as slow as possible.

        "comment": "1. It needs more levels--the iOS version has more, why not Android? 2. Dragging items around the screen was sometimes unresponsive on my Nexus One 3. After the bubble stops moving, or is sufficiently far off the screen, the physics simulation should automatically stop. 4. Even better than just more levels would be the ability to generate your own levels, much like a lot of the tilt maze games do. Some of the levels are more interesting than others, so let the community come up with really creative ones!",
