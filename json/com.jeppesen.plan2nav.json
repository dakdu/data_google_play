        "comment": "Update - was a trial to get all running but is a nice product once it works\\tI finally got everything running.  I think one problem is that I am used to the instant gratification of buying something and being able to install instantly.  With Jeppesen, it seems like their email confirmations, etc, take a 24 hour or so period to get issued to verify your status.  For the number of copies sold, you would think this would be faster.  but i do like it!  Program installed fine on my Galaxy s3 but doesn\\'t seem to want to track to my GPS.  It took a couple of days to get the \\'invite\\' email to confirm my email, and then I went ahead and bought my local chart.  Can\\'t figure out how to download that chart although it does say I now own it. Tech support is helpful but there is a 12-24 hour waiting list for responses.  I would dearly like to make this work to have the captain data available.  and, scarily enough, when you go to the website for technical support and look at the faq, it says that this software is ONLY available for IOS, so at the very least, they are not too excited about the android capabilities, and at the worst, the android announcement is premature?  I\\'ll report back when and if I get this all working and perhaps increase my rating when and if!",

Always have to hit GPS button to center map on your current location, unless you are underway, then its hard to search other parts of map.  The UK and Western European coast charts are great value for money.  Again viewing and searching the charts works better on smart phone than tablet.",

While the app. from Jeppeson is free the maps are far more expensive and leave so many bodies of water not covered unlike Navionics with everything included for $30.00. I have both now but I can see that Navionics is the best bargain. I hope Jeppeson follows Navionics and offers an all in one purchase and covers more lakes and rivers in their package.",

        "comment": "although Google play does not allow this app to be downloaded to so called \\\"incompatible devices\\\" it may run perfectly on them; therefore 5 stars! Reason for incompatibility not found (manufacturer / model / region / language / location service / GPS ???)  Rooting was needed to download the APK (other trick later discovered: APK downloader). Plan2Nav installed fine on chinese iFive-MX tablet, registered and downloaded detailed maps. Testing oke thus will buy the needed charts.",
