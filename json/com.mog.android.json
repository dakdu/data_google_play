        "comment": "The sound quality of Mog cannot be beat. I subscribed to ALL of the services available, including Google\\'s new streaming service, and compared them all. Sure it\\'s easy enough to look up what bitrate each service uses, but I wanted to see if I could actually hear a difference, and I could. Mog wins.   However, now that I\\'ve tried all the various services, I find myself wishing that Mog\\'s radio function was as clever as Pandora, that they had a desktop app like Rhapsody, and landscape in the mobile app.",

Because it\\'s THE app. You can have stations that focus on only one artist! You can also choose they song you want to listen to, instead of that station! Along with varied listening modes, like a \\\"discovery\\\" mode. The app could use a tweaks here and there, to make it more atteactive and simple, but i\\'ll have to settle with the current one because what they offer is perfect.",
