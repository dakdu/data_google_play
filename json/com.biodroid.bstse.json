Over the years I\\'ve spent about \\342\\202\\2543000,- ($4000,-) on surfing merchandise, most of which from Billabong. I truly thought that the app would be a nice customer reward. Just something to mess around with because they appreciate all the money and support we gave the companies we pay for. Turned out to be another capitalistic application, doing everything it can to give you the bare minimum and lure you into paying them even more money. I don\\'t care about the money, I can afford it. But I hope Billabong doesn\\'t forget what the target is about. I don\\'t think that the capitalistic exploitation of a group that tends to be in a rebellious sub-culture works out pretty well.",
