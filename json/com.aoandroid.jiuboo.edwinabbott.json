    "description": "Flatland: A Romance of Many Dimensions is an 1884 satirical novella by the English schoolmaster Edwin A Abbott. Writing pseudonymously as \"A Square\",[1] Abbott used the fictional two-dimensional world of Flatland to offer pointed observations on the social hierarchy of Victorian culture. However, the novella's more enduring contribution is its examination of dimensions; in a foreword to one of the many publications of the novella, noted science writer Isaac Asimov described Flatland as \"\"The best introduction one can find into the manner of perceiving dimensions.\"\"[2] As such, the novella is still popular amongst mathematics, physics, and computer science students.Several films have been made from the story, including a feature film in 2007 called Flatland. Other efforts have been short or experimental films, including one narrated by Dudley Moore and a short film with Martin Sheen titled Flatland: The Movie.---------------------------âFlatland: A Romance of Many Dimensionsâ is an Android Book App built on Jiuboo Book Template.
