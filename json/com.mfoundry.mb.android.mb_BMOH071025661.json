But...uh...seriously??? I can no longer use the app in landscape mode??? REEEAAALY??? That would have been really challenging programming?  So now, I do 80% of everything on my phone in landscape, I launch this app and I have to turn it to portrait to log on, can only navigate through the menus and different functions in portrait, BUT when I take pics of checks I\\'m trying to deposit the app requires landscape (landscape for the front pic, return to the deposit form in portrait, then landscape again for the rear pic, return to the deposit form in portrait), finish my transactions in portrait (which I very much do NOT like for most of my phone usage), and then after logging out and closing the app I have to rotate it one last time to get back to landscape to proceed with other activities on my phone.  This app is fine overall. Seems like functionally it may have been improved some, but why the heck would you make it portrait only when the previous app auto-rotated?  DER.",
