        "comment": "in general the game is good, in terms of fun and challenge. it exceeded my expectations, because from the screenshots it didnt look so appealing, but I downloaded it because I read a series of articles on your blog. So, great job! However, I noticed a issue, on my Samsung Galaxy Ace, I.m not allowed to quit the game by pressing the Back button. The only way to exit the game is to press home, and kill the process, which I found annoyng, and per me I see it as a bug.",

        "comment": "Great game. The tutorial articles are great too. There are a couple of things that need fixing such as on my tablet when I\\'m portrait mode the screen is very long and it takes a long time for the ball to travel that distance, so there must be a way to shorten it say for example making the bottom area bigger. Also the back button doesn\\'t exit the game like normal apps.",
