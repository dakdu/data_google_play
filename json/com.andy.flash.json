Previously, my tablet wouldn\\'t allow flash. But when this program prompted me that I need flash I downloaded it. Now my tablet is complete thanks to this gem.",

        "comment": "running on the Samsung tab android 4.1.1. it probably works because I downloaded Adobe flash player 11.1 for android 4.0, this I got from the Adobe archives. Apparently Adobe no longer supports the android platform so the 11.1 player will probably never be upgraded. Anyways this app does a good job so far even with the older version of flash. If you need Adobe flash player try getting it from Adobe archives not from anywhere else, and then get this app if you have SWF videos to play.",

        "comment": "I have been looking for days to find out why my brand new Nexus 7 cannot install Adobe Flash Player, just to find that adobe only lets it install on older devices that originally had flash player and has made it unavailable to something new. So I can\\'t view websites done in flash, no flash video.games, no amazon instant video.  Supposedly adobe air can fix the issue but seemed to do nothing to help.  Want the real Adobe Flash Player? If yes like me, find it at APK4(dot)us for the latest version. Amazon instant videos won\\'t have sound but so far all other features of Flash seem to be working normally.  Please spread the word so people are not searching for days on how to pull the flash.apk file from their old phones. AGAIN I Have a Google Nexus 7 and an old Motorola Atrix.",
