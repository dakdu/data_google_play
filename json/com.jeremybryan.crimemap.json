    "description": "The Chicago Crime Map is an Android application that utilizes the Chicago crime dataset and Google Maps. Currently, existing crime applications simply display each individual crime as a bullet point on a map. The Chicago Crime Map, however, divides the city into 1,000 meter squares and displays a rating for each individual square. This rating is displayed via a simple color overlay that ranges between green, yellow, and red. Much like a weather map where green represents tame climates and red often symbolizes high heat or extreme weather, green on the Chicago Crime Map are historically areas of low crime, yellow depicts a moderate crime rating, and red warns of a historically high crime area. By creating a color spectrum of crime ratings rather than individual bullet points, the map becomes less muddled and overwhelmed. There are thousands of data points within the Chicago crime database and condensing that valuable information into a color coded crime guide will help make it more user-friendly. To further increase usability Chicago Crime Map also has multiple overlay maps available for viewing. Based only upon the information provided by the city of Chicago crime database, an attempted statistical analysis (or algorithm) was developed into the default map view. Within this default map, areas of historically high crime verses the areas of historically low crime can be easily differentiated by their respective color. This algorithm calculates a crime rating for each 1,000 meter square and assigns a color solely based on the Chicago crime data. The crime rating is assigned by statistical data comparison; essentially, each 1,000 meter square is compared to all the other squares on the map. In other views a user can change their map based on a specific type of crime: assault, battery, burglary, criminal damage, homicide, narcotics, prostitution, robbery, sexual assault, vehicle theft, and violent.
