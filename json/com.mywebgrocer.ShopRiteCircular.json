If I could it would be a full 5 stars.  In fact I have to admit, I enjoy ordering my groceries through the app, rather than the actual website, since now my tablet can basically function as an interactive grocery list that I can easily take out to the kitchen & take stock as to what\\'s in my cupboards.  If they add a way to add items I search for on my tablet then I\\'ll gladly give this 5 stars!",
