        "comment": "The general layout of Vagaro is great. Unfortunately there isn\\'t much continuity between the app on my phone (Samsung Note 2) and my tablet (Google Nexus 10). There\\'s certain things on my phone that run smoother than things on my tablet and vice versa. My number one problem is that if you check the option for starting cash you can\\'t enter thst in from either of the apps, you have to go to the desktop site. Of which I can\\'t access from my phone easily because it keeps trying to be a mobile site.",
