Check if Dragon is running on your computer.\\\"  I did check and it was running and I did load the \\\"Android Mic 1\\\"  as my user profile, which is the name that I used on the Android when the Dragon App. was open.  I used the barcode to sync them and the IP address and the computer port number that appeared on the Android was the same as on the computer.  I re-did the entry on the Android numerous times to no avail.  I am disgusted with this app.  Does anyone have a solution?",

It is way too sensitive but other than that, I love it to death. Can you fix the sensitivity on it? It really needs to fix bad.",

I prefer the android version over the iPhone version because it continues to work after the screen times out, unlike the iPhone version of the same program, which is not the fault of Dragon \\342\\200\\223 but instead, Apple\\'s iOS.  Highly recommended if you are a Dragon user - download and enjoy.  Personally, I use it in conjunction with a Shure microphone clipped to my shirt for hands-free dictation.",

        "comment": "I am trying to use this app with Dragon Naturally Speaking Home Version v12.  Here\\'s what I experience: After creating a profile and choosing this app as my input device, I am continuously having trouble with it. When I press the microphone button on my phone, 90% of the time I get a \\\"Connection Problem Detected\\\" error. I have tried rebooting the router, and even re-installing the app. I might get lucky and get input in a single session... but if I close the app or otherwise come back to it, it errors out again.  Then I decided to change inputs to the microphone headset included with the software. Guess what? You can\\'t change input methods within the same profile! So if I change inputs, Dragon has to re-learn me all over again.  Out of sheer desperation and disgust, I called Nuance Tech Support, who proceeded to tell me that even though every other app on my phone uses my wireless network flawlessly (as does my computer), the Remote Microphone app is NOT the problem... that I have a wireless router problem. Their solution? Spend another $80 to upgrade from the Home version to Premium. BRILLIANT!  I advise you avoid this app like the plague.",
