    "description": "The original and best version of Klondike Solitaire 3D, also called Patience! It features amazing graphics, as you can choose your own images!  Game solutions are available if you get stuck!  Move the cards easily with drag and drop, or point and click.  It features full undo and redo history with the back and forwards buttons, you can even replay the game you just won.  Keeps normal or Vegas scoring, or no score at all if desired.  The game animates from the shuffle through to the play and a mesmerising winning sequence where you can repeatedly blow up the cards!  Lots of graphic options like animation speed, motion blur, shadows, colored highlights and choice of backgrounds, decks and deck backings (with more on their way).  Other customizations are sound, auto play, left or right hand dealing and the ordering of the Ace bases.Let me earn your 5 stars.  For whatever reason this is not a 5 star game for you, tell me and I will try to make it so.  I respond to all emails.Developed by Jonathan Barton.",
