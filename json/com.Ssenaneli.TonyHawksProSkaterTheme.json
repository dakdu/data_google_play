    "description": "Tony Hawk's Pro Skater Wallpapers and Theme ApplicationTony Hawk's Pro Skater is a skateboarding video game developed by Neversoft. Published by Activision in 1999, it is the first entry in the Tony Hawk series of video games. Development began after Tony Hawk's debut stint at the 1998 X-Games. Pro Skater was originally released for the PlayStation on August 31, 1999, and was later ported to the Nintendo 64, Dreamcast, and N-Gage. It also received a Game Boy Color adaptation. All versions except for the Game Boy Color version met with critical acclaim from critics, who praised it for its innovative gameplay, level designs and control scheme. It was also commercially successful, selling rapidly upon its opening month. The game resulted in a successful franchise that continues to be active to this day. It has recently been revamped in HD for the Playstation Network, Xbox Live Arcade and Steam, and is available for download as of July 18th 2012.This app will add a few search access points on your device.
