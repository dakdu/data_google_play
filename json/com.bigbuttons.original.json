        "comment": "what else is there to say?  one problem, on my htc One S running ics, it\\'s not possible to type an uppercase letter T or G or L, you\\'ll get lowercase. that\\'s rather weird, and the suggested free version for later android versions is incompatible with this device, so i\\'m stuck with this version. also, the installation guide states that the 2-step process to activate it may not be enough and that you may have to reboot, which is indeed the case (take note in case you think it doesn\\'t work with your device) and still after that you might have to pick the input method from the status panel after the 1st boot. regardless, those are very minor annoyances compared with constantly hitting the wrong keys in the htc sense input panel. if you have problems with the small standard keyboards try this one, you\\'ll be glad you did.",
