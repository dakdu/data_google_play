    "description": "The ONLY floating window IRC chat application for Android. Perfect for tablets!Chat on the go while reading email, browsing the web, watching a video or playing a game, like a real PC.Note: This application is still under heavy development, so there will be frequent updates and new features.For help and support, you can visit the IRC channel #floatirc on irc.stormbit.netNote: SSL option is not working yet!If you have any issues with the app, submit a bug report and email me before you rate the app, so I can try to help you. Features:  - Floating IRC windows that can be minimized to the notification tray.  - Supports multiple servers at once, each in their own window.  - Notifications on nick highlight.  - IRC color and formatting code support, including background colors.  - Multiple channels per window, easily switchable with a drop-down menu.  - Collapsible nicklist to maximize screen real estate.  - Default settings for new servers, making server setup quicker and easier.  - Automatic crash reporting, meaning most bugs should be fixed quickly. No personal information is collected.  - Auto-connect to servers on startup.  - Auto-join channels on connect.  - Auto-identify with services.  - And lots more!Permissions required:  - SYSTEM_ALERT_WINDOW: To display floating windows.  - INTERNET: Without this, the client wouldn't be very useful.  - ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE: To detect connectivity changes.  - READ_LOGS: To send crash reports. No logs from other apps or personal information is collected.  - READ_PHONE_STATE: To include the device ID in crash reports. No personal information is collected, this is only used in order to know which crashes are from the same device.",

        "comment": "I must say, I\\'m astonished at the rate in which this application has been developed. Only days ago, Jdbye had been talking about the lack of any floating IRC clients for Android, and since then he has built it up from scratch to it\\'s current state. For a beta, it\\'s as fully featured as anyone could ask for, indeed it certainly exceeds the quality of nearly every mobile IRC client I\\'ve ever used. However, I digress. Simply put, it\\'s a windowed IRC client for Android. One that can be run on top of (in parallel) to other applications. Needless to say this is a godsend for tablet users, who previously were forced to run painfully stretched (and yet still somehow cramped!) clients full-screen.  All basic IRC tasks are achieved, it can connect to multiple servers and join a multitude of channels on each. Every aspect of your IRC \\'identity\\' is configurable, et cetera. Rather surprisingly, it also includes complete colour support - something of a rarity on mobile platforms. Overall I cannot restate the sheer amount of flexibility and convenience that this application affords the end-user. Definitely recommended for usage, and knowing Jdbye\\'s track record, it can only get better. - Alex",
