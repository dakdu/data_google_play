        "comment": "By all the comments I would assume this is an excellent app to learn Java on. Unfortunately it won\\'t run on my galaxy tab 10.1 so I can\\'t give it the rating it probably deserves.......  In response to the developer, I have reinstalled the application 3 times now and it still won\\'t open.  I\\'m a computer network engineer and have been in the cell phone industry for 3 years now.  The app doesn\\'t work on my device, even after a full wipe/reload of the Android operating system, so I\\'m rating it based on that result.  The Play Store says it\\'s compatible with my device, perhaps it\\'s not.  When it works on my Galaxy Tab I\\'ll adjust my rating, till then it\\'s staying 1 star.",
