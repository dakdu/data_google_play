        "comment": "Worked well on my gnex and my wife\\'s razr. Got new phones and now it won\\'t sync on either of them.  Followed support on the website still no luck. Guess I now have 250 dollars of colorful paperweights.  Going back to fitbit.  I noticed on the UP website this is common on android where these won\\'t sync.     UPDATE: I DID EMAIL YOUR SUPPORT BEFORE WRITING THIS REVIEW< THEY DID NOT READ MY EMAIL AND WERE NOT HELPFUL AT ALL.  Thank you for posting canned responses and sending me robo emails instructing me to do the steps I already stated I had done.  Also for the record, JAWBONE suggested that if the new phones don\\'t work with the Jawbone or app that I should just borrow a friends phone whenever I want to sync my device.  That is an awesome suggestion, don\\'t use your $700 phone to sync your $150 dollar device.  Go find a friend with another phone and sync with his phone!!!!! Great advice Jawbone I will be sure to do that.  I own a lot of Jawbone products and after this fiasco will not be purchasing or recommending anymore.",

        "comment": "I\\'m very dissapointed in jawbone for advertising android support and not giving it. Can\\'t do anything with it on my phone, no unlocking and obviously no syncing. Tried everything..  I bought this band because I\\'m drawn to it by it\\'s design and I\\'d like to see statistics about my everyday moving. Too bad jawbone didn\\'t deliver.   Better score when android is properly supported.",
