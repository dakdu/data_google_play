        "comment": "Here we are, 4 months after my initial review... it still sucks, but not quite as badly.  It is functional, and it will do the job it is supposed to.  However, if you turn the screen while it is loading, it crashes.  You cannot exit the software with the menu or the <Back> key, and when you use <Home> to put it in the background, it crashes the next time you use it. I called Jack Henry & Associates today, and got voice mail - so I left a message, trying to be helpful... as an Android developer myself, I offered to give them my time for free to help debug the problems (I already know why they happen).  Not a call or a word in response from them.  So here is the bottom line: while the app is functional, I would not recommend it to anyone.  I would also not recommend Jack Henry to any bank who is looking for a banking app -- the company is not user-friendly, to say the least!! =================== Like Elizabeth, below, I tried to login using my NetTeller credentials -- and it promptly told me my account was not active.  However, it then locked up my phone -- I had to break to my Home screen and use \\\"Manage Apps\\"
