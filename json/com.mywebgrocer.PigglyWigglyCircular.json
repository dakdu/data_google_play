        "comment": "Not sure why so many 1 star reviews.  No comments on any of them...  This is a handy app that does what you would want from a grocery store app.  It does require you to register with Piggly Wiggly, but if you are downloading this, then you\\'ve probably already registered with the site.  After registering, you can assign a store as the store you shop at and you get the weekly specials for that store.  You can then easily and quickly add the items to a shopping list.  Anything not in the weekly advertisement you have to add manually to the list which is probably the only negative.",

For instance, 3 six pack sodas for $9.99; can we buy multiples? So if I got 6 six packs would that get me each at 9.99?? Its little things like that which would make this app superb. Both for customers and employees- I can see this app being used to help people around the store.",
