They meet and instantly dislike each other, but are they so different after all?â¨As they work through their differences, Tim and Sammy deal with issues of one-sidedness, prejudgement, food intolerance and ultimately, conflict resolution all in a light heated, fun story.See the trailer (iOS) here:http://www.jellybiscuits.com/?page_id=390* Built for Tablets* Studio recorded voice reading by the author of the book, Glenn Melenhorst, with word-by-word highlighting.* Word by word narration - touch a word to have it read to you.* Automatic page turn option to have the whole book read to you, or Reads As You Turn.* Mini map for fast navigation through the book.

        "title": "Great story for adults & their kids",
        "comment": "My daughter and I love this book. The illustrations are great and the story is funny albeit with a wicked sense of humor. (Some parents may object to boy-eating aliens but it helped the book\\'s lesson of needing to add vegetables to one\\'s diet.)  I do have a few suggestions. I like how the book was interactive, however; I would have liked if the book was ALSO able to display and say words when clicking on objects in the book similar to how other interactive books behave: i.e. \\\"Hop on Pop\\\". Perhaps the developer could add that feature and allow users to turn the feature on or off. (5 stars if this could be done)  Another observation is that the book was wonderfully narrated with a British man\\'s voice except when a little boy\\'s voice is used to list the names of the different types of sausages, which was difficult to discern. Perhaps that part could be recorded again so it is easier to understand.  Overall, a great book!",
