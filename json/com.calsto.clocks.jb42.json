    "description": "Based on the official Jelly Bean 4.2 analog clock from the Nexus 4, these widgets link to your stock alarm when pressed and come in 10 color schemes - and the best part is theyâre all free for you to enjoy on any device and show off to your friends!â To apply a colored JB 4.2 clock widget, long-press anywhere on your home screen and select the widget menu to locate the style of your choice. The widget menu can also be accessed by pressing the menu button on your device while on the home screen, or through the app drawer if youâre running 3.0/4.0+â The app drawer icon leads to an info screen with more detailed instructions, and was included to make sure users donât think the app is missing after downloading from Google Play and trying to press the open button. If you already knew that widgets donât usually open then pat yourself on the back for taking the time to read ;)â We have partnered with a few innovative advertising companies in order to support further development and keep our apps free for all users to enjoy. Rather than obtrusive banners or annoying push ads, this app provides a few useful shortcuts on your device in the form of a search bookmark link and home screen icon. This gives us a few cents each time the app is downloaded and will help us out a lot in developing more apps. If you do not want to use these new tools, you can simply ignore or delete them by dragging the icon to the trashcan and no harm is done (our app remains the same, no need to uninstall it). Thank you!â Avast reporting as malware?! No it's definitely not malware, it is the AdNetwork's SDK which has been certified by Verisign and fully approved by Google. Avast and a few other outdated scanners will mark this as a potential risk because of the required permissions, which is just their stubborn attempt at making users worry over nothing to get exposure on the market and make their own app seem less pointless. Don't be fooled, use a scanner with legitimate identifiers like Lookout Security or AVG. Read the privacy policy located on our site or contact us for more info.â Then why are there so many permissions? Well, most are required for the widget, shortcuts, and alarm controls. The others are necessary for our AdNetwork's SDK and are explained in more detail here - http://www.startapp.com/permissions/. All permissions added are completely harmless and at no point do we collect or store any personal information! Our user's privacy is a top priority, but please feel free to contact us if you have any questions or concerns.Android is a registered trademark of Google, Inc.",

        "comment": "It\\'s weird to report this on a clock widget of all things, but it seems to make my phone lag. Not in a heavy way, but animations like opening app folders skip frames when this widget is up. Things like HTC\\'s stock clock widgets and Yahoo\\'s Weather widget don\\'t affect my phone at all, but this one seems to do it. Otherwise, I\\'m a huge fan of the minimalist design and the colors are good choices.",

        "comment": "Nice options. It would be be brilliant if it could utilize a color-picker so we can choose the exact color. Also, I\\'m a little offended that that widget is called \\\"Colored Jelly Bean Search Bars\\\". I think it should be changed to \\\"Multiracial Jelly Bean Search Bars\\\". My feelings are a little hurt, but it\\'s ok because the widget is cool.",
