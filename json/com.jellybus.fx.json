        "comment": "This is a five star app, but I wanted to subtract half a star because it doesn\\'t give the option to work with the photos in their original size. PRO is well worth the price for all the fun things you can do, though, and in most cases the maximum resolution is plenty big enough. The ability to put a freehanded cutout from one photo into another is so cool. Also, this is one of the few apps where you can edit individual color graphs as well. Love the flexibility of the text, freestyle drawing on the photo and the multiple undo/redo levels. Suggestions: allow original size, allow landscape mode (a lot of my photos are landscape) and either put some zoom sliders in various places, or allow us to pinch/zoom and put the \\\"original\\\" view into an icon somewhere on the screen.",
