        "title": "Very Realistic simulation of a Modern Pachinko Machine.",
        "comment": "This game will be very confusing to those not familiar with the game mechanics of a modern pachinko machine, or to those who are unable to read Japanese.  Of course some of the advanced features of the program may not be clear without a full translation.  It also appears that there is some \\\"registration\\\" feature that allows you to login and keep statistics.  However, if you are familiar enough with modern pachinko, you will be able to play the game without the need of translation.  The game includes reach and super reach modes in addition to the Kukuhen and Jitan Bonus modes.  The goal is to win as many balls as possible.  The player begins with a stake of 5000 balls.  Payouts are given when balls enter certain pockets of the machine.  However the real goal is to direct balls into the center \\\"start\\\"  pocket below the \\\"LCD\\\" display to start three numbered reels spinning.   If you match three numbers, you enter a bonus mode which lasts 15 rounds where a rectangular pocket opens below the start pocket.  Balls entering here payout more balls and during this bonus mode it is possible to earn 1500 or more balls",
