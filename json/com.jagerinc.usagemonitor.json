Although if set on the most accurate of options, the app still barely impacts battery life but you may still want to tone it down.The backup and restore features allows you to keep your usage data through factory resets or even uninstalls. Backup the databases just before you uninstall or factory reset and when you install the app again it will automatically restore on first run. You can even transfer the backup to another device with this app and restore from it. You may also choose to manually restore the database to a previous backup.
