    "description": "Glympse is the easiest way to safely share your location with someone in real time.  No sign-up needed and no new social network to manage.  Recipients receive a link allowing them to view your ETA and location in real-time for the length of time you choose.When the timer on your Glympse expires, your location is no longer visible.  Best of all, recipients do not need any special software to view a Glympse. Send a Glympse via SMS, email, Facebook or Twitter, and recipients can view it using any web-enabled device.  You can also send a Glympse to your Evernote account to save that journey. -- Awards & Press --* \"[Glympse] is one of those apps that's ingenious in its simplicity, insanely handy to have around, and just a little bit fun to boot.\" -CNET Reviews* \"Glympse: The Coolest Thing Your Smartphone Can Do\" -Fast Company* Named one of \"15 Best Mobile Apps of 2011\" -Mashable-- User Testimonials --***** \"This app is awesome...

It gives people peace of mind, and the option to see it in a web browser is awesome for those who don't yet have the app. Also, it's nice that you can set the Glympse to expire upon arrival for saved battery life.\" - Bradley Dunham via iTunes***** \"Thanks u guys!!! This is so awesome! Now when my parents want to know where I am I just send them a Glympse!!! Thnx!\" -via Glympse Support***** \"I Glympse during bike races so my fam knows where to intercept me. When I'm heading back from a meeting, or when we are heading to other's location.\" -98Buff via iTunes***** \"Absolutely LOVE this app! I take the bus home from work and my husband picks me up at the bus stop. I send a Glympse when I get on the bus and he can track the location. We also use it when we are running 5k, 10k and half marathon races.
