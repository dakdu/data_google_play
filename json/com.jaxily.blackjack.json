    "description": "Blackjack is a friendly casino card game that you can try to get the most chips compared to other blackjack players. This Blackjack app is designed for phones and tablets so Enjoy on any device.  Enjoy the large playing cards and voice comments as you play. Feedback and comments welcome! Blackjack, also known as Twenty-one, is the most widely played casino banking game in the world.[1] Blackjack is a comparing card game between a player and dealer and played with one or more decks of 52 cards.The player or players are dealt an initial two card hand and add the total of their cards. Face cards (Kings, Queens, and Jacks) are counted as ten points. The player and dealer can count his own Ace as 1 point or 11 points. All other cards are counted as the numeric value shown on the card. By virtue of this, approximately 31% of the cards in a deck are ten point cards. After receiving their initial two cards, players have the option of getting a \"hit\" (taking additional cards) to bring their total value of cards to 21 points, or as close as possible without exceeding 21 (called \"busting\"). The dealer will usually take hits when his two cards total less than 17 points. Players who do not bust and have a total higher than the dealer, win. The dealer will lose if he busts, or has a lesser hand than the player who has not busted. If the player and dealer have the same point total, this is called a \"push\" and the player typically doesn't win or lose money on that hand.",

        "comment": "I like this version BC it is simple.  But it would be nice if the rules were accurate.  If I have BJ the dealer shouldn\\'t keep drawing cards and then sometimes cause a push.  Or if the dealer has blackjack the hand should be over before I split or double down.  And last I checked you can\\'t split when you have 7 and 5 or 8 and 6.  I like the gameplay just wish the rules were more accurate.",
