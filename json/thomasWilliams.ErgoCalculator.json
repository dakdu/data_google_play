Using this information the App will automatically calculate your weight adjusted scores and your predictions using Paul's Law.  Additionally each time you press one of the calculate buttons a record of it is stored in your history.  This is a great feature as it allows you to keep track of weeks worth of workouts and training plans.  The History will record the Date/Time, your Distance, Time, and AvgSplit.  To access your history go to the Calculate Tab, press the menu button, and select History.You can calculate your Distance, Time, Average Split, Weight Adjusted Scores, and Predictions using Paulâs Law. You can also view World Records and compare yourself against the best.
