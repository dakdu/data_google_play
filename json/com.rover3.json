        "comment": "Update: App has been improved! Video doesn\\'t freeze anymore!   Glad to see the devs are working on it, even of they are silent. As others have reported, it is a taggy and the slidder controls would do better to be buttons.  Tried this app on my friends iPhone and it works perfectly.  The Android market is unfortunately not the devs top priority, and it is a shame because the tank is really cool otherwise.",

        "comment": "\\342\\230\\205\\342\\230\\205\\342\\230\\205\\342\\230\\205UPDATE JULY 31...., New update came down from the gods and how everything works properly.  This tank is fun. Wish it were a bit faster, but still a blast...........Device looks ultra cool.  Drives with no problem.  Connects through wifi just fine.  All controls seem to work except live video. After a few seconds video freezes.... Have to close app and then reopen only to find video freezes after a few seconds ad nauseum.  Also,  application occasionally seems to force close.  What is the fun of a spy tank if live video does not work?  It\\'s a real shame too.  Device is cool and would definitely be fun if this problem was to be addressed... But unless it is,  the product is to expensive for a remote control tank with no video capability. I will advise if I can find a work around our If dev team responds with instructions. Does anyone else have these problems or constructive answers/solutions? gregautry@gmail.com",

On Galaxy Nexus the app won\\'t install.  I bought this as a Christmas present for my now very disappointed daughter. Exchanged it at the Brookstone store today, assuming the robot itself was faulty, but the replacement unit had the same trouble (and kept dropping wifi), so I\\'m back to the mall _again_ to get a refund.   The robot is cheaply made and not worth the price. The app clearly is not finished - if it can\\'t run on a Nexus device it clearly has been inadequately tested. Avoid.",
