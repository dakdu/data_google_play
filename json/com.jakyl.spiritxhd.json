Intelligent concept, great graphics, awesome music and skillful animations.  No need to shoot anything and that matters very much.  I\\'d still like to get some sort of check points so there would be no need to go to 7-1 every time I play. Also, please make the touch more sensitive.  It had been requested on iOS and fulfilled.  I don\\'t see why can\\'t it happen here....  Excellent, excellent concept.  Great work!!!",

Touch the icon, screen goes black, and in 10 seconds the Android home screen reappears. Is this a game problem or new os problem as samsung had pushed an os update too.  Thanks!",
