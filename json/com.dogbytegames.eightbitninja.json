Replaying the game repeatedly to earn money is a chore. Make a free and a paid version. For endless \\\"whatever\\\" games, the game play better be engaging.  That is just not the case.  The fruit is barely near the character and it crushes him.  Cheap deaths occur constantly. Fun for a few minutes and uninstalled the next. Thanks.",
