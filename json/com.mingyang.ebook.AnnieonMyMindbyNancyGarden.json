    "description": "I remember this book as the first \"gay\" book I'd ever read. This was waaaay back when I was a little naif, and barely had any idea what a lesbian was, let alone realized I was one. The basic plot is that Liza, the pov character, meets a girl named Annie and they become friends and realize they are in love with one another. Liza goes to a private school and is the class president, and Annie is from a working-class Italian family and goes to public school. When Liza volunteers to feed the cats for two of her vacationing teachers (who share a house), she and Annie end up using it as their little love nest and also discover the two teachers are, in fact, lovers and not just roommates. Then a busybody from the school ends up catching not only the two girls, but also finding out about the gay teachers. The school has an inquiry on the situation, flirts with the possibility of expelling Liza (they don't) and fires the two teachers.What I remember most about when I read this wasn't actually the book itself, but the fact that after I'd read it, I was talking to a friend about it, describing the plot and stuff like we always did with books we'd read. I was rather incensed about the fact that the teachers had been fired just because they were gay and so I was ranting about that. And my friend didn't understand why that seemed so weird to me; obviously a school should fire gay teachers. And that gave me pause for a moment, because it just had not even occurred to me that people would really feel that way; I had been mad at the book because it seemed like such a completely evil thing to do for no reason at all and I thought it was dumb and unrealistic. Illusions shattered!",
