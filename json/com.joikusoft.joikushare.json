        "comment": "Using my Android phone own hotspot for wifi connection for JoikuShare (AndroidAP - portable hotspot).  This way JoikuShare just simply works in a split second.  Downloading phone shared media (photos, music, videos..) is easy with the HTML5 browser experience (laptops, other phones).   Uploading PC files works (just uploaded a PPT into my Android with JoikuShare program).   Playing music on TV is super cool. Its like airplay but the other way around. Now can kill the AppleTv and save one extra HDMI slot on my TV to something more useful. Just opening my TV browser and connecting to my Android to stream phone media wirelessly.",

Now I got email from Joiku tell me they releasing a new software for android devices. Its still a great software, let me send my files to my friends phone (unfortunately with efford) And I already have a software to send and receive my files to a PC in same wifi network and manage my phone.  This software is great, but days when people difficult using this kind of software is over. Please make more simple, I will support and buying full version :)",
