    "description": "Allows anyone with Grand Theft Auto III for android to enter cheats into the game. Opens up the keyboard in game and displays a list of cheats available. No need for a physical keyboard anymore, everyone can cheat.Please read the troubleshooting or contact me before posting a 1* review. Half these comment are covered in the troubleshooting. Especially the people with the Galaxy Note, troubleshooting clearly tells you to download a specific keyboard if the cheats donât do anything.Important: Asking questions within the comments section on this page will not get you a response as developers can't view the email address of reviewers and have no way to reply to comments. Please contact me directly. Instructions1.\tOpen cheater app and press âStart Cheaterâ.2.\tStart the game.3.\tWhile in game press the new âCheatâ button at the top of the screen.4.\tFind the cheat you want.5.\tEnter it in the on screen keyboard that opens.6.\tWhen you finish playing, open the cheater app again and press âStop Cheaterâ to remove the âCheatâ button.Please note: For the people that have given bad reviews because the guns cheat doesnât work. It does work but there is no confirmation message like some cheats, try changing weapon and you will have them all.Also note: The flying cheat for cars doesnât make them fly; it lowers their gravity so they can glide. This is enough to fly over the broken bridge onto the second island with fast cars such as the mafia car. If you get a tank, it can fly if you rotate the turret and fire backwards while this cheat is activated.",
