The app pulls info right from the CA Dept. of Transportation so it\\'s as accurate as it can reliably be. My only qualm is that it doesn\\'t use your GPS location to filter highway statuses.. so you have to scroll through all notices to find the one(s) for the area of highway you\\'re looking for. It\\'s only an issue if there\\'s a lot going on for the artery you\\'re looking at.",
