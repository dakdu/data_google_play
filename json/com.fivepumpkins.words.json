    "description": "v6.2: Bug fixv6.1: Editable cardsSight Words â Help prepare your child for kindergarten. Designed for children who are ready to learn to read and review sight words, this shows each word on a separate card in large font.  * Use Edit Mode to change the words. Make it your own deck by adding your voice or your childâs! Add or change words as you need to.  * Star the cards that you would like to review with your child and use the Favorites Mode to create your custom deck. * Change the settings to display lower case letters or UPPER CASE letters using the Toggle Case settings option. * Randomly show a letter using the Random Button. * Swipe through the cards, or use the large buttons to move from word to word.  * Turn off the audio using the Quiz ModeAt Five Pumpkins, we strive to make high quality apps and distribute them for free on Android. We want to help as many children as possible learn their alphabets and gain a solid grounding in pre-reading and pre-math skills. We really hope these are as much for your toddlers and preschoolers to use as they were for us to build. If you would like to donate and support our development efforts, please contact us at info@fivepumpkins.com. If you have ideas for other toddler applications or kids games, feel free to let us know. We love to hear from our users. You can see our other educational apps and games by searching for \"Five Pumpkins\" in the Android Store or checking out m.fivepumpkins.com.

It has been punishing Android users for months now with no way to escape these green symbols on the upper left corner of our expensive phones  that cost us good money for the device and expensive data plans mean nothing to Google and the direction their once cheap alternative to Apple\\'s game changing iDevices and mobile platform which I can speak informed about since I have a lot of smart devices, 4 being Apple iPhone4, iPad2&2012,latest iPod Touch. 6 Motorola Droids: Razr Maxx,Razr,Bionic,DroidX2,DroidX,Droid2,HTC Incredible,2,Eris,Samsung Galaxy S,Galaxy Nexus and an Original Palm Pre, whose HP abandoned WebOS has been main features have been pillaged by Android 4 ICS, much as iOS features were borrowed to my delight since I never cared for who protects their clients from spam ads. amongst other FLAWS in Google\\'s growing but worsening Android platform not in quality since they stole every feature from RIM, iOS and now to my delight, ICS steals the best features of webOS. All in all I own way more Droids and prefer the larger screens to iPhones 3.5 that was the biggest albeit for a short while. STOP ruining this mobile platform with these stealth ads Google or I will render my droids as wifi game devices and buy iPhone 5 and Android will never earn a penny from me and I will make others follow me. I want to remain loyal but want you to allow users to opt out after the first unwanted ad.\\tMy 2\\342\\205\\235 year old boy loves this app",
