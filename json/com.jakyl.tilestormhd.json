        "comment": "Now most apps require being connected via wifi/3G/4G just to use them. Google must be suggesting these permissions that seem to be adopted by more & more developers. AdMob seems to be running constantly on our devices, contributing to their search engine. I enjoy JB & ICS, which like iOS 6.1, allows users to opt out of notifications, but games play without having to be connected on iOS. Yet we\\'re spied upon & spammed 24/7 on Android. Remember the days when they gave out free phones to get money for service?",
