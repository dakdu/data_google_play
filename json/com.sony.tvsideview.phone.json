The limit on channels that you can toggle should not exist either, I can\\'t add all the channels I get.",

        "comment": "One problem with Sony is that they ditch support for products very quickly, so if your other Sony products are anything other than box fresh then there\\'s little chance of getting this app to work with them. It\\'s still marginally useful though, but frankly not worth the effort for most people.",
