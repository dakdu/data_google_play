You can search for channels in the U.S. and other countries by country, state or province and county. Find channels close to your location based on GPS or 3G/WiFi triangulation. You can save your favorites, listen in the background, and get instant access to new feeds as they come online. Use it to monitor exciting police, fire, and rescue frequencies, stay abreast of these activities in your area, and be prepared for disasters or other emergency situations. â It's like Jersey Shore, but not really. â Whether you like reality shows or hate them, you'll love listening in on real police, fire and rescue communications. Police Radio brings you more than 2,000 channels including public safety, air traffic, marine and amateur short-wave frequencies, all easily searchable. â Find sources close to you. â When you could hear your neighbors yelling over your own TV, you knew what they were up to. It's when they suddenly got quiet that you had to wonder. No more! With Police Radio, you'll know as soon as the authorities do! â Never boring! â Find channels with the most activity and listeners. Search U.S. feeds by state and county. Also search international feeds. Roger, Porkchop. Whut's yer 20? Learn new words, and new ways of combining familiar words. We were going to list this in the Education category, but everyone laughed.
