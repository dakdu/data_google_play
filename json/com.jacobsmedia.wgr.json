        "comment": "It worked fine before the last update. A few glitches here and there but I could deal with that. But since the update, NO sound will play unless I am connected via WiFi. If I open the app while on 4GLTE or 3G no sound plays, and it won\\'t close (quit). I have to FORECLOSE it through the app manager on my phone. I have Uninstalled it and reinstalled it and I got the same results. Is there a way to roll back an unwanted update? Please help! I am not in the Western NY area so this is the only way I can keep with the John Murphy show unless I am in front of a computer. And I am mostly NOT in front of a computer.
