Downloaded via link on website, opened app and it automatically logged me in and immediately began to download all the shows I had chosen, without any problems with speed or connection via wifi. I like the fact that the app has a huge amount of customization options , right down to font size and button placement.",

        "comment": "I use to love this app. I had questions in the past that were promptly answered, but just recently on 7/24/2013, I submitted a question because of issues I am having with my new Galaxy S4 . Today is 7/30/2013 and I have not received any reply from support and also from the link to the CEO I used. If you record just one program the app is free so you have nothing to lose but DO NOT give this company your money for this app until you start seeing posts about the company actually doing some positive support. Very disappointed in the app and support for multiple recordings.",
