All I ask is just, put tilting action on and put videos of random people game play. Like pick people off the street and make a really hard challenge if they beat the challenge they get the game free but if they don\\'t have the 4g android they have to past half you have to part half. They should do that for android you can do this if you want but just fix the controls please that\\'s all I ask=5star",
