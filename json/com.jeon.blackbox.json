For whatever reason Samsung Galaxy 2 saves everything on the phone even if it says saved to sdcard it saves files & apps to the device memory unless it says saved to sdcard then it saves everything on the partition USB Storage. I hope you get the bugs out soon. I know its very hard to make 1 app that works on all",

Only complaint is that the Speedometer is only working in KM/h even though I select MPH, so the measly 300 million of us living in the U.S. can\\'t use the speedometer.  Also wish you could select a digital speedometer option.  Would be MUCH easier to see, especially while driving, which translates to safety.",
