    "description": "BETA application and if phone reboots on taking photos try uninstalling applications since memory on Backflip & Cliq is limited.Motorola Backflip and Cliq built in camera application does not provide GPS tagging in the photos using EXIF headers.  This application uses the GPS in your Backflip or Cliq to embed the GPS location in the photos you take in this application.  Note, due to limitations with Motorola Backflip memory the photos are currently fixed to only 640x480.  If we can figure out a way around the memory limitations we will try and increase the resolution size.The GPS fix can take a long time (or not at all) when indoors.  The application disables GPS when a fix is received.  Use \"Reacquire GPS\" button to update your GPS fix.  This saves battery by not constantly getting GPS coordinates.Files are saved to the sdcard in /DCIM/Camera and can be copied off the phone using photo applications like Picasa, Flickr, etc.Basic camera function to take a photo and GPS tag it.  We will be adding additional functions such as flash control, white balance control, zoom, etc.",
