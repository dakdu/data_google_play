        "comment": "Game keeps forceclosing, hence loss of 1 star; drops another star because there is room for improvement - I don\\'t know why I\\'m training horses but if I swap for another to speed up game play (which is otherwise too slow) and later revert back to it then the training has gone back down. I also think you should be able to retrieve horses you\\'ve used previously for fewer coins",
