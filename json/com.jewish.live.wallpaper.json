Like the Book of Revelation, which would recycle many of the apocalyptic motifs set down in the Hebrew Bible, the works are difficult and full of symbolism, but from them one can gather three basic eschatological concepts: the new world to come, the resurrection of the dead human body, and the Messiah (Novak 114). The Hebrew word Mashiach (or Moshiach) means anointed one, and refers to a mortal human being. Within Judaism, the Messiah is a human being who will be a descendant of King David continuing the Davidic line, and who will usher in a messianic era of peace and prosperity for Israel and all the nations of the world.Hebrew revelations cast a wide net, drawing on biblical prophecy (though Jewish apocalypticism predates Christianity, they later developed alongside one another), Mesopotamian and Zoroastrian traditions, and ancient Israelite myths. Though the visions change, the basic familiar framework remains the same: the dead are resurrected; every human being are judged and meted out his proper reward; Godâs enemies are destroyed; the Kingdom of Heaven is established on earth.Personal and social eschatology are closely tied together; the journey of the individual soul is not complete until the worldâs life cycle is finished, as well. Humans are resurrected and judged, and it is only after the world has ended and Godâs Kingdom established that individuals will enjoy the fruits of their righteousness in life.Enjoy having this amazing religious background inspired by Judaism and the people of Israel!=============Ads information:This app is ad supported.
