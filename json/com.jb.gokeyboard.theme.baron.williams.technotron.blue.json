    "description": "This skin works with: Go Keyboard (FREE), Ultra Keyboard (FREE), Smart Keyboard (FREE Trial), TSwipe-Pro (FREE), Better Keyboard (+ Unlock Key), Perfect Keyboard Pro, Super Keyboard Pro, and ICS Keyboard donation.No, thatâs not a misprint. This skin is a hybrid skin supporting both Go Keyboard and Better Keyboard formats. It works with all of the keyboard apps currently on the market that support these two very popular skin formats.The BDW Techno Tron Keyboard skin contains black keys with futuristic neon blue glow lights. The background is an array of cyber power beams.TABLET AND PHONE COMPATIBILITYSupports all standard phones and tablets running both new and legacy Android systems (OS 1.5 and up). This skin has separate images for phones and large tablets, so the keyboard images appear very crisp and detailed on all standard phones and tablets.TABLETS AND PHONES TESTED WITH THIS SKINPhones and tablets tested include everything from small phones to extra large 10â tablets:Arnova 10 G2 TabletArnova 7 G2 TabletHTC WildfireSamsung Galaxy AceSamsung Galaxy NexusSamsung Galaxy NoteSamsung Galaxy S3Samsung Galaxy Tab 7.7Samsung Galaxy Tab 10.1Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 7 InchSamsung Galaxy YSamsung Infuse 4GAnd more!USAGEThis skin is very easy to use. If you have compatible keyboard apps already installed, and you open the skin, the skin shows you a list of all the compatible keyboard apps installed on your Android, and gives you separate buttons for each of their settings. The skin also displays very clear easy to follow instructions for each keyboard app detailing how to use the keyboard skin with the keyboard app.If you donât have any compatible keyboard apps already installed in your Android the skin will present you with a screen allowing you to directly download one of several compatible keyboard apps by simply pressing a button.The skin also includes a test area for you to type in to test the skin (after setting up your keyboard app to use the skin). You can long press the test area to select different input methods to see how the skin looks using the compatible keyboard apps you have installed on your Android.PHONE KEYBOARD APP RECOMMENDATIONSFor the best experience using this skin, I recommend using Go Keyboard, or Ultra Keyboard.TABLET KEYBOARD APP RECOMMENDATIONSIf using a tablet, Super Keyboard Pro and Perfect Keyboard pro are excellent keyboard apps. Both have a landscape mode split keyboard layout thatâs great for tablets.Go Keyboard works well on tablets in portrait mode but very poorly on tablets in landscape mode unless you use their special âPAD MODEâ plug in. Unfortunately their âPAD MODEâ requires special tablet only skins which are sadly incompatible with their normal skins. We do have a tablet version of this skin available for Go Keyboard âPAD MODEâ.SEE MY OTHER SKINS!To view my other skins using this keyboard skin open the keyboard skin by selecting itâs icon in your apps menu. Then press âGet More Skinsâ to view all of my other skins on Google Play.I have a whole line of skins with a broad range of styles from professional business style skins to colorful rock style skins to pink skins designed for girls, and much more.",
