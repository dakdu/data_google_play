This new free kids game has 20 levels of running, jumping and eating fun.  Fat Pig is a great free kids game to keep your kids happy with a cute fun game!  FAT Pig Run was inspired by our own kids and created this fun game with them in mind.  Our kids love this fun free kids game and is great for all ages.  The first levels are quite easy for young kids, but levels gets increasingly harder for big kids as you step through each levels.  FAT Pig run obviously loves to eat, run and jump! This particular fat pig has the sweetest tooth who simply cannot get enough of those yummy cupcakes!  If you like cupcakes, well watch out because he is going to eat them all.  Feed fat pig enough cupcakes in each level to get three stars at the end!But watch out, as you progress to the next level.  There will be new obstacles in later levels that this little FAT pig has to encounter.  Like, the black holes that can send FAT pig spiraling down into the deep blue sea!  Each level can be played again so don't worry if you if you don't finish each level, but you need to finish each level to move to the next level.FAT Pig run is not only fun but also has an incredibly fun graphics that will surely be pleasing to the eyes of children and adults! Download FAT Pig and let the excitement begin!  Happy playingIn âFat Pigâ you control a pig and your goal is to eat as many cupcakes as possible, while avoiding to fall into the water or black holes. The game is structured in 20 levels and is targeted mainly for kids, though waiting in line at a doctorâs office might be good as a time-waster for adults as well.    âWhen the pigs flyâ â¦ tap. Controlling your character in âFat Pigâ is very easy, when each level starts if you tap once the pig starts running, all you have to do subsequently is simply tap when you want to jump over an obstacle or to change your direction to collect items. This is one of the reasons that makes the game suitable for kids, you basically control the game with a single tapping finger. The pig will also do a rotation when it jumps, but thatâs just for show.    Collect cupcakes. My experience with pigs is that they will eat anything and everything but in âFat Pigâ heâs lucky enough to eat only cupcakes. All throughout the game the goal is to eat as many cupcakes as possible, the more you eat the higher the score (but kids, in real-life you have to eat balanced meals). At the end of each level you are gratified with a large cupcake, that you reach in a Mario-esque jumping style.    20 levels. The game has 20 different levels, and as you progress you are able to play any of the ones youâve already finished. It starts easy, as in the first level there is only a little water you have to jump over (and as a tip if you fell in the water just tap again to get out fast), but subsequent levels increase a bit in difficulty. In higher levels there will also be new obstacles, such as black holes, falling rocks and youâll get help from jumping springs.    Twinkle, twinkle little pig-star. When you finish a level you receive stars based on how well you did, basically the higher the score the more stars you get (to a maximum of 3).    Fun graphics and sound. âFat Pigâ has fun graphics and a soundtrack fit for the situation and enjoyable for kids. If you donât want to hear any music or sound effects you can disable it from the main screen of the game.    Itâs free. The game is free and only shows an unobtrusive ad (on larger screens, such as on a tablet, the ad is shown all way up to the right where itâs barely noticeable.",
