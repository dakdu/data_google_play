    "description": "**GO SMS Pro needed! Install it from the Play Store if you don't already have it!**The best and more accurate GO SMS Pro iPhone style theme on the android market, with all the buttons and conversation bubbles like the original. Compatible with most common resolutions, it's a perfect match for your GO Launcher EX and GO Locker iPhone theme. Try it and rate it if you like it (5 stars make me happy! :P)If you have any problems, write me an email, I'll answer to you as quick as possible. Follow Me on Twitter http://bit.ly/Q0cPDk for the last news and updates. You can also write me there for support.FONT:I can't add the iPhone font in my theme for legal reasons, but probably you have already the right font in your phone! Try to go in Appearance settings and select \"Scan Font Packages\".Then go into Conversation customization and in Incoming and Outgoing font try to find the HelveticaNueueRegular and apply. Don't change the conversation list font because you will loose the color effect on selection. If you don't already have the font in your phone, you can buy it here Helvetica Nueue. I'm not affiliated in any way to the font seller.SENDING BAR:I'm sorry but for now go sms pro doesn't allow those modification to the animations, so I really can't add the sending bar and the sending animation of the bubble for now. If and when they will add those features I will immediately update the theme.Thanks**Disclaimer**:The word iPhone is used here to describe a graphic style. I don't own the trademark on that word and I'm not affiliated in any way with it's owners. This is only a GO SMS Pro theme that mimics the sms interface of the most famous phone in the world.***Remember***: this is a GO SMS Pro theme, so you need GO SMS Pro installed on your phone (it's free). Then you can select the theme called \"Iphone (iOS) Theme\" from the GO SMS Pro Theme settings, it will be the last theme down on the list.If you want the support for the Iphone emoji you simply need to install the GO SMS emoji plugin (it's free).",
