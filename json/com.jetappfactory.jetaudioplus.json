Recently, I re-down loaded jetAudio and discovered this program is excellent and equal in ability to any \\\"high-end\\\" player on the market. My only request for improvement is the ability to edit metadata files (similar to Poweramp) and add \\'surround effects\\' ( like the Maven Player).  Throw in A rating system for individual songs and jetAudio would be almost perfect!",

        "comment": "jetAudio Plus is the best audio player I tried (along with PlayerPro and PowerAmp, two of the top players available to Android) and I tell you why:  * 20-set equalizer with preamp.  * Sound effects to boost bass, widen the stereo image (both with three groups), and setting for Hall, Room, Stage or Stadium.  * AGC (Automatic Gain Control) setting to bring the loudness of your songs to a more even level.  * Four different user categories - so you can easily apply different settings to various music.  * You can control the speed of your music.  * Choose a starting (A) and end (B) point in a song and then repeat just that part.  * Choose between several pictures before downloading missing album art.  * Timer to stop or start playback so you can fall asleep or wake up with music.  * While you play a song you can click on a button which gives you options to find the song on Youtube, share it via Bluetooth or email, or post it on Twitter or Facebook.  jetAudio has still other features but this presentation is already way too long, but it\\'s such a well-crafted app that I wanted to motivate the 5 stars I\\'m giving to it and encourage others to give a try to this excellent audio player.",
