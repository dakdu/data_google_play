In etymology, the Semitic hÃª probably first represented a praying or calling human figure (hillul 'jubilation'), and was probably based on a similar Egyptian hieroglyph that indicated a different pronunciation. In Semitic, the letter represented /h/ (and /e/ in foreign words), in Greek hÃª became epsilon with the value /e/. Etruscans and Romans followed this usage. Although Middle English spelling used â¹eâº to represent long and short /e/, the Great Vowel Shift, changed long /eË/ (as in me or bee) to /iË/ while short /e/ (as in met or bed) remains a mid vowel.ID-TECH is a leader in developing apps for android devices like widget , live wallpapers and apps to play mp3 and midi music and other stuff.We can develope flash any kind of of app for Android, and some of them needs root access.You can personalize your device with cool animation and video effects, improve your mobile phone and launcher these apps.Check for other apps in the market like  clock, weather forecast, battery monitor, health etc...Relax and feel free to contact us for any issue or suggestion by e-mail : idtech2012@gmail.com or over skype : idtech2012You will never get angry with these apps!Tags: decoration fantasy fun widget classic  funny cool photo personalize design personal drive original fashion alphabet name letters Edecorazione adesivo fantasia divertente classico foto personalizza alfabeto nome lettere composizione E",
