You will love spending some free time with Primo.Edwin \"Eddie\" Carlos ColÃ³n (born December 21, 1982) is a Puerto Rican professional wrestler. He is currently signed by WWE wrestling as Primo. He is the son of Carlos ColÃ³n, Sr. and the younger brother of wrestlers Stacy and Carly ColÃ³n, better known as Carlito in WWE. He began wrestling in the World Wrestling Council, where he won the WWC Universal Heavyweight Championship five times, as well as numerous secondary and tertiary titles.In 2007, ColÃ³n signed a developmental contract with WWE, being assigned to Florida Championship Wrestling. In this promotion he was teamed with Eric PÃ©rez, forming a tag team known as The Puerto Rican Nightmares. On February 23, 2008, they became the first wrestlers to hold the FCW Florida Tag Team Championship. Upon being promoted to the main brand, he was teamed with his brother. Subsequently, The ColÃ³ns became the first team to hold the WWE Tag Team Championship and World Tag Team Championship at the same time, making them the first Unified WWE Tag Team Champions.ColÃ³n is the son of retired wrestler Carlos ColÃ³n, Sr. and the third youngest of four siblings, including Carly ColÃ³n and Stacy ColÃ³n, both of whom have performed with ColÃ³n in the World Wrestling Council. A second sister, Melissa did not enter the wrestling business. Other members of ColÃ³n's family have also been involved in the World Wrestling Council, including his uncle JosÃ© ColÃ³n and cousin Orlando ColÃ³n who have been involved in several angles within the company.ColÃ³n debuted on 1999, wrestling in the Cruiserweight division. He won the first title on February 10, 2001, when he defeated Damian Steele for the WWC World Junior Heavyweight Championship. His feud with Steele continued for a month, during which he dropped and recovered the title on March 10, 2001. He feuded over the title for six months, losing and winning it once. By autumn, ColÃ³n was involved in a storyline involving Justin Sane, continuing a similar pattern. In early 2002, ColÃ³n was involved in a storyline with Rey Mysterio, Jr., who defeated ColÃ³n for the title on January 6, 2002. Mysterio held the title for two months before dropping it back on April 6, 2002, which marked ColÃ³n's final Junior Championship reign. Following a feud with Kid Kash, the belt was held up and ColÃ³n ascended to the Heavyweight division. Shortly after Carly ColÃ³n signed with WWE, a tournament was organized to determine the new champion. ColÃ³n was considered an early favorite and reached the final, but lost. ColÃ³n then entered a feud with El Diamante over the WWC Puerto Rico Heavyweight Championship. In late 2004, ColÃ³n was involved in a Battle Royal for the first contender's position. One week later on November 6, 2004, ColÃ³n defeated El Bronco and won the Universal Heavyweight Championship for the first time in his career. He then entered a feud with El Diamante, eventually dropping the title to him. In late 2006, ColÃ³n signed a developmental contract with WWE. On July 31, 2005, he formed a tag team with his father as part of the Funking Conservatory's television show, !Bang!, competing against Dory Funk, Jr. and Johnny Magnum. The team was victorious, winning the promotion's Television Tag Team Championship. On March 5, 2006 he participated in WCW Saturday Night tribute show World Wrestling Legends: 6:05 The Reunion when he face Vampiro. ColÃ³n wrestled Christian at Aniversario 2007, the World Wrestling Council's anniversary event that took place in the JosÃ© Miguel Agrelot Coliseum on July 13, 2007. The result of the match was a double count out disqualification.He occasionally returns home to train and get better with his cousin Epico and his brother Carlito ColÃ³n.",
