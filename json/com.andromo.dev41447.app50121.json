You make the decisions that will keep you alive or get you eaten by a flesh eating zombie. The walking dead can spring up from anywhere and you need to have your wits about you. Will you stay away from the undead long enough to survive and make it to the extraction point? Will you get your brains eaten by the walking dead? With no survival guide you will have to fight a war against the undead using your instincts.You Decide games are tongue in cheek adventure stories that give you a chance to decide the outcome of the story, putting you in the heart of the action. They have a sarcastic humour/humor to them and could be seen as offensive if you are sensitive that way. This free app contains the first three chapters of this story..Here is what you can expect:Chapter One - The undead uprising starts and you have to escape the cityChapter Two - You have to get your way out of the zombie infested woodsChapter Three - The walking dead chase you into a theme park, but can you keep it safe?Zombie Survival Premium, containing all six chapters is also available on Google PlayIf you love watching The Walking Dead, Night of the Living Dead, Dawn of the Dead, Shaun of the Dead or pretty much any blood soaked zombie adventure you will enjoy Zombie Survival You Decide.You Decide games are text based, low tech games which will probably last about 10 minutes. They won't change your life but will hopefully give you a laugh while you are playing them. Check out my other apps for similar types of games.Keywords: Zombie survival, walking dead, undead, adventure, choose your own adventure, you decide, story, andromo, funny, sarcastic, choose your fate, choice,living dead,walkers,zombie apocalypseThis application uses Google analytics to anonymously track usage data within the application.",
