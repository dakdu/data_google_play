I\\'ve joined a couple of groups but I find that there is no way to get to the current posts on threads created and there is no way I\\'m going through 10k posts to get to the most recent. This is easily resolved by either current posts need to be at the top of the thread, the app needs to take you automatically to the current posts or there is an option to skip pages. So instead of going page by page one can skip to the end. Once this gets done I\\'ll add the extra star.",
