Then I installed this app so I can do hands-free photos. I can get my rabbit posed then say \\\"Cheese\\\" and get the picture. It does seem to be a bit of a problem if I am too far from the phone, so I am going to try this with my wireless mic. Also, I need to do some experimenting on how to get the focus properly adjusted. Altogether though, I am very pleased.",
