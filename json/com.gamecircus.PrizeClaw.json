I have to wait for over a day for my grabs to regen and then they only last maybe half an hour or so per machine. And there are also times that almost all of my grabs that I had been saving and waiting for disappeared! I should have over a hundred grabs on each machine I only have 10! And some kind of prize or bonus for completing the puzzles would be nice. Fix those and you\\'ll have my 5 star rating!",
