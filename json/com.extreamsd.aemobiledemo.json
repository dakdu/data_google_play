The iRig is of better quality and playback is done through its headphone output. Note that hardware monitoring is not possible and you won't hear what you are recording through the headphone.Please see our extensive topic on latency in the online manual: http://www.audio-evolution.com/manual/doku.phpTags: audio recording, audio recorder, multitrack, j4t, DAW, iRig, fourtrack, fourtracks, audio editing, audio mixing, audio mixer, mix, cubase, cubasis, audio editor, fl studio, audacity, sound, pro audio, usb audio, multitrack audio, usb audio recorder, zquence",
