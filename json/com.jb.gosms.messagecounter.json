As it is seen in all their apps, the go Dev team focus on beautification of the interface and not quality. Every app has a thousand themes but has low intelligence level and poor utility value. They must understand that a smart phone user looks for intelligent and productive applications and not themes and pictures and colors.  Uninstalling the plugin.",
