    "description": "Not your ordinary blackjack app - a real blackjack simulator with standard Vegas rules, packed with customizable features and different game modes!Regular Mode is a completely realistic blackjack simulator (card order in the shoe is randomized during the shuffle).  Shoe is 6 decks by default and is shuffled 3/4 of the way through.  If pro features are enabled, these can be customized.  You start with 1000 chips and $10,000 in the bank.  You can \"borrow money\" if your bankroll goes negative. Stats are tracked so you can see your performance over time!  Start a new session anytime from the stats page.New in version 1.5: You can enable many of the \"pro features\" for free!  Note that this will also enable an ad bar at the bottom of the screen but you can always uncheck the setting and turn the ads and pro features back off.  The pro features include:*Expected Value (EV) calculated live for every play based on the up cards.*Customize the rules, # of decks, and when decks are shuffled.*Lots of stats tracked for both the current session and overall including stats on your double downs, splits, and hand distribution.*SurrenderPlus 3 additional game modes:*Cheat Mode stacks the deck in your favor.  Despite what some reviewers seem to think, the deck is randomized in Regular Mode.  However, in Cheat Mode it is harder for you to bust and less likely for you to pull a low card on a double down.  If you'd rather win than have realistic odds, Cheat Mode is for you!*Sim Mode allows you to prepare yourself for any scenario you may face in a casino.  Its not actually a blackjack game - you can't win or lose bets - but it allows you to see your EV for any possible hand.  Click on either of your cards or the dealer's first card to choose the value of that card and see what your odds are.  Click a card again to change its value.  Not sure if you made the right play while at a casino?  Enter the hand in Sim Mode and find out!*X-Ray Mode: Wouldn't you like to have a pair of X-Ray glasses at the blackjack table that allow you to see the dealer's hole card?  Now you can with X-Ray Mode!*Note on permissions: These are required by Mobclix for ads.  However, you must enable pro features for ads to be run at all.  The choice is yours.",
