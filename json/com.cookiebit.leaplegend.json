Also, I had a bug where the help book from before you start a run was on the screen while I was playing, so I would accidentally push it while trying to switch sides, because it was directly above the button.",

A great game with a great built in way to earn coins that is as non-intrusive as possible.  That and I mentioned on another websites forum that I would like to see a Shopkeeper one-liner disable button... and this update brings it!  I\\'m totally taking credit for that.",
