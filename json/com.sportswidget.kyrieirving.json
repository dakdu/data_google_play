He was the second child to be born to Drederick and Elizabeth Irving. He has an older sister, Asia, and a younger sister, London. His father played for Boston University then went on to play professional basketball in Australia for the Bulleen Boomers.[1] Irving lived in the small town of Cue, Australia before relocating to the United States when he was two years old.[2][3] He has dual citizenship in the United States and Australia.[2] Irving's mother, Elizabeth, died from an illness when he was four, so Drederick raised him with the help of Irving's aunts.[3] He grew up in West Orange, New Jersey, where he often went to his dad's adult-league games.[3][4] His inspiration to play in the NBA came after playing at Continental Airlines Arena during a school trip in fourth grade where he stated \"I will play in the NBA, I promise\".[3] As a teenager, Irving played for the Road Runners of the Amateur Athletic Union (AAU).[5][6]Kyrie Irving played for Montclair Kimberley Academy his freshman and sophomore years in high school. He averaged 26.5 points, 10.3 assists, 4.8 rebounds and 3.6 steals and became only the school's 2nd 1,000 point scorer. In his sophomore year, he led Montclair to its first New Jersey Prep 'B' state title.[5][7] After that year, he transferred to St. Patrick High School because he felt he needed a bigger challenge.[5] He had to sit out the first 30 games of St. Patrick's season due to the transfer.[7] While at St. Patrick, Irving played with Michael Kidd-Gilchrist, who was widely regarded as one of the best players in the class of 2011.[8][9] In his first season at St. Patrick, Irving averaged 17.0 ppg., 5.0 rpg., 6.0 apg. and 2.0 spg. He also led his team to their third New Jersey Tournament of Champions title in four years. In August 2009, he played in the Nike Global Challenge in which he led the USA East to the tournament title. He was the MVP with 21.3 ppg. and 4.3 apg[6] The following year, St. Patrick was banned from the state tournament for holding practice prior to the permitted start of the winter sports season.[6][10] Despite being banned from the state tournament, St. Patrick went 24-3 and won the Union County Tournament championship. Kyrie finished his senior year with 24.0 ppg, 5.0 rpg. and 7.0 apg.[6] In his two years at St. Patrick, he lettered twice.[1]On January 19, 2010, Irving was selected to the 2010 Junior National Select Team. The team played at the 2010 Nike Hoop Summit at the Rose Garden in Portland, Oregon, on April 10.[6][11] He was also selected to play in the 2010 McDonald's All-American Game and the 2010 Jordan Brand Classic, where he was named as co-MVP with Harrison Barnes.[12][13] In June 2010 Irving was a part of the United States gold medal winning team at the FIBA Americas Under-18 Championship.[14] Irving was the #2 player in the class of 2010 by Scout.com,[15] #3 player in the ESPNU 100,[16] and rated as the #4 player by Rivals.com.[17] In addition, he was ranked #1 among point guards by ESPNU in 2010.[18]INSTRUCTIONS:To add a widget, go to widgets menu, choose widget to add widget, hold and drag to empty space.* Legal / Credits: *The Comic book/Comic book name, images, characters, logo and other details are not created by us but by their respective owners.* Advertising *We include a monetization platform to keep this app 100% FREE*Ads Agreement.*Creating an app takes time and money, In order to keep creating great (and free!) apps, we are using a new search service to monetize our apps.
