It really helps, thanks!In supporting my creation of themes, apps, and beyond, please note that this theme comes with one or more of the following: Airpush/LeadBolt/SendDroid, which periodically displays ads in the notification bar. Also, a small number of icons will be presented on your phone's desktop, which can simply be deleted. (Hence the permissions.) Again, this helps support me in the evolutionary creation process of themes, apps, music and more. You can always download a free Airpush blocker from Google Play, download the donation version which is free of ads ( https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.jb.gosms.webtheme.neondream.donate ), and/or send me musical instruments.
