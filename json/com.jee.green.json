Will move to 5 stars when the issue is resolved.  UPDATE: Excellent developer support. Emailed back and forth with me many times, and the initial email response was a mater of hours. Sent me several test APK, and eventually was able to get the issue fixed.",

It would be great if it could automatically read your city\\'s weather and if you could add a comment to multiple plants simoultaneously (like the time they were watered or the amount of time spent on light). Maybe if you could group some plants. Still, it is great for small crops, I just copy paste.  Love the look and friendly interface.",

I would be giving this app five stars but it doesn\\'t seem to have a good way to share the journal I\\'ve created with other people and devices. You can only share one plant entry at a time. And it shows up as a picture. Needs a way to view the app from multiple devices.",
