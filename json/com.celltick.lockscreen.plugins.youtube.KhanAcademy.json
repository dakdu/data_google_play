Schools are still in there lnfentcy, and only thinking outside of \\\"the classroom\\\" will be the first steps toward the Future of all learning. I wonder how many synapses are connecting all because of one man\\'s helping his niece with her home work ? This is truly \\\"One small step  for education but one GIANT LEEP FOR THE MIND\\\"!!! Think about it.",
