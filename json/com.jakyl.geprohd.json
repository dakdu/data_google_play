        "comment": "If this game is in HD, then the cast of the Jersey Shore are Mensa members. There is no way this in HD resolution! The only possible way that it could be in HD, is if the original non-HD version of the game looked so incredibly terrible, that well, its so bad you can\\'t even tell a difference with the supposed HD upgrade. I know video games and resolutions well, and man this game looks awful. I\\'m assuming the developer is trying to entice more buyers and woo them with the promise of some stunning HD pictures. I think its similar if you tried to make a cartoon like \\\"Steamboat Willie\\\" in HD after the fact. Yeah it may have been glossed over with an HD sheen, but its still going to look ancient. And that is this game to a tee, it appears to have come off the Amiga computer.  I can only imagine how much more I\\'d feel ripped off if I had purchased the \\\"XHD\\\" version, sheesh! This might please some, but for the asking price you could do a lot better with other offerings on the Market. At least play the demo if there is one before you buy this. Just my two cents...HD cents.",
