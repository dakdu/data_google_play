Needs alot of work, expected more with the size of the total download! I m sure the avatar part can be removed and focused more on the game sync and social part",

I ran across this app, and got excited because it clearly says that it is compatible with my device, yet when i go to use it after it has been installed, it says that it is not compatible with my device! So....what now gameloft? Fix your app, and i will fix my rating",

        "comment": "I can see where Gameloft was headed with this app but it has one huge problem - it doesn\\'t sync properly. I\\'m guessing Live was meant to be a Microsoft avatar/Sony Trophy achievement display app which you then can socialize with friends. But if the Live doesn\\'t sync at all with the other Gameloft games how it is supposed to do what it was designed for? Fix the bugs so it can run like it was meant to. I\\'m sure I\\'m not the only person with this problem.",

However, I am not a fan of having to purchase clothing for my avatar with real money (maybe 50 cents for a hat, and a dollar for a complete outfit wouldn\\'t be so bad). I think the avatars need more poses and backgrounds, for their snapsnot. I would like to see deeper interaction with other players, like a HUB where you can walk around and interact with other people (chatting, sitting, dancing, etc). That would definitely make come back more often.  As it is now, I really just use it to update my Gameloft profile pic. :/",
