Now every time I launch the app I don\\'t have to enter my lengthy email address and password! Please keep up with the updates... I\\'d like to see an indication of the system running at the time I login, or how long it was running since the last time it was on... The graph at the bottom of the app that shows run time is a bit hard to read even using a browser interface.  Maybe a daily chart of how much run time would really be nice to glance at.  Great work!",

App looks just like the stat screen which isn\\'t a bad thing, only makes sense to have the SAME ability\\'s and functions as if your at the stat but it doesnt. Needs to show icons for current status in real time, menus should be available as well but they are NOT.  App does the basics pretty well other than it relies on a web server with no direct connect option available? Cm\\'on! Lastly the UI really needs a tablet update.",
