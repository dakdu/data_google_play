    "description": "Find that perfect song for the perfect moment, instantly!Street Beats helps you search for music on your device by metadata (i.e. name, artist, album name, genre, or even by year), or by lyrics.  You can submit a search by typing in the query into the box, or by speaking your query into your device after hitting the large Microphone button.  The name \"Street Beats\" hints at the facilitation of music queries while you should be paying attention to other things ;) but you're welcome to use it outside of the car as well.In \"Metadata\" mode, your music files must have correct tag information in order to show up in results.In \"Lyrics\" mode, you can submit a portion of the lyrics, then a lyric search service (ChartLyrics) will retrieve all matches.  Lyrics queries also attempt to find and help you play music from services like Google Music, Last.fm, Pandora, or Spotify (if your device has these programs installed).\"Hum\" mode is coming soon.  I left the tab in as a teaser.Once you see the results, you can play one song by clicking on it, or export each song found on your device from among the result set into your favorite music player.  (At this time, only Lyrics search results found on your device will be added to the playlist.)Regarding lyrics results, keep in mind you may have better luck by either avoiding or using proper punctuation in lyrics, and by avoiding numerals (such as \"5\" -- type \"five\" instead).This application was developed in conjunction with the Interactive Audio Lab at Northwestern University.  They are a federally-funded research group by the NSF in the United States, and are working on an interesting query-by-hum system called Tunebot.  It will be incorporated into Street Beats once their new servers are rolled out, and pending regulatory approval.  This will allow you to query for music on your phone by singing or humming it!  Meanwhile, you may contribute to Tunebot's body of known music at tunebot.cs.northwestern.edu.",

DON\\'T MAKE FALSE CLAIMS PLEASE",
