    "description": "Do you love Sin Cara?  Do you want to play games with him as the star?  Well now you can!  With this great app you will be able to play Sin Cara memory, jigsaw puzzles, and Tetris.  You will love spending some free time with Sin Cara.Luis Ignascio Urive Alvirde (born December 22, 1982) is a Mexican luchador enmascarado, or masked professional wrestler, signed with WWE and appearing under the ring name Sin Cara (Spanish for \"without face\" or \"faceless\"). He is best known for his time in the lucha libre promotion Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre (CMLL) under the ring name MÃ­stico, where since 2006 he was the main tÃ©cnico (face/storyline hero) in CMLL and the biggest box office draw in all of Mexico. MÃ­stico is Spanish for \"Mystic\", a religious ring character who is the storyline protÃ©gÃ© of the wrestling priest Fray Tormenta. Upon signing with WWE in January 2011, Urive was repackaged as Sin Cara.Urive is the son of Manuel Almanza, who wrestled under the ring name \"Dr. Karonte\", the brother of wrestlers Astro Boy, Argos, Argenis and an unspecified member of Los Mini Psycho Circus, the cousin of wrestler Magnus and the nephew of CMLL booker Tony Salazar.Training and early career (1998â2003)Urive was trained for his professional wrestling debut by his father and his uncle Tony Salazar who is a retired wrestler that works as a booker for Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre, Mexico's oldest and largest wrestling promotion. MÃ­stico made his debut on April 30, 1998 working as \"Dr. Karonte, Jr.\" at the age of 15. In 2000 he changed his ring name to \"Astro Boy\" in honor of his older brother who had died months earlier, who had worked as the original Astro Boy. Later on he was joined by another brother who worked as \"Astro Boy II\" to form a tag team. In 2003 MÃ­stico travelled to Japan to work for Michinoku Pro where he was billed as \"Komachi\", a ring persona he took over from fellow luchador Volador, Jr. who had played the part for about a year.",
