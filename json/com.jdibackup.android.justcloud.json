        "comment": "My initial effort at using JustCloud was terrible. It claims 15gb storage for backup... I tried to backup well under a gig. At 187megs, it simply balked and has proudly touted that figure at me in all of the ads it\\'s throwing at me every 15 minutes on my computer after I synced the two. Not to mention the announcements that the service is only free for 15 days. I don\\'t mind paying if the company is upfront and honest.  Going back to Drive. At least you really get what Google claims you will.  Uninsta Google",
