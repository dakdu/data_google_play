    "description": "This is a very simple Egg Timer / hour glass I wrote, to try and work out how to program for the android platform.Put simply it counts down 30 seconds and then fires a notification when this has expired, there should be an alarm but I've had some trouble getting that bit to work.The program works both as an Application, a Widget and I might get it too work as a notification as well if I get the time.  Its currently very simple and \"unfinished\" and has quite a few missing features, or features I would like it to have. I've put it up on Android Play partly to work out how Android Play works, and partly because I could not find many similar apps and thought others might find it useful.My wife suggested it as I nice simple idea as she had been looking for an app to help her cook, but as I'm sure you'll imagine the possibilities are endless with quite such a reasonable simple app, I'm surprised its not part of the standard app set, (Hundreds of Stopwatches, not no count down timers)To Do:1. Alarm when timer expires2. Improve Graphics and Icons 3. Repeating timer 4. Setting Page so it can time other things than 30 seconds (or multiples there of)",
