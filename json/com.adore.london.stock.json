        "comment": "Thought it was good at first but now it deletes all the shares i\\'m keeping tabs on every time i close it.  I\\'ve given up using it now until this is fixed. Also on a side note, the data and charts of each share is minimalistic.  Good for keeping track of things but no good for research or analysis. Still worth downloading despite this.",
