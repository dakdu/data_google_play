        "comment": "I would like this keyboard if I didn\\'t know about Messagease. I learned W10 quickly, and would choose it over a QWERTY board, but you can type letters on Messagease with single taps as opposed to the swipes W10 requires, which makes typing on Messagease much faster and easier. Access to special characters and punctuation is also much more user friendly on Messagease.",

I know that I can \\'swipe up\\' to switch between these two types but the swiping doesn\\'t work well (inserting unwanted spaces or letters) and even annoying. Can the makers of W10 add another feature that allows me to set the default keyboard type for each language separately?",

        "comment": "I was recently thinking of writing a similar keyboard after becoming frustrated with GKOS\\'s tiny buttons. It\\'s great to see something already out there! The combining is very easy to pick up, however there are some glaring problems that get in the way of fast typing. Number one is the swiping - every time i try to type an \\'r\\' or \\'s\\' quickly the keyboard dissappears or the layout changes. There\\'s also a few unfortunate combos... it\\'s impossibie to type \\\"to\\\" fast because it changes to \\'p\\'.",
