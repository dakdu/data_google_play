Perfectly usable without the subscription which adds synchronisation features to allow data to be synced automatically between devices, but as a multiple device user this is a brilliant feature. If the Ireland and UK formula were built in this would be perfect, but this can be added under Custom Formula: Round(((16 * protein) + (19 * carbs) + (45 * fat) + (5 * fiber)) /175)",

Since I\\'ve been using this for over two years and have gone up and down quite a bit that is a major shortcoming.  The widget could be very motivational if this could be fixed!
