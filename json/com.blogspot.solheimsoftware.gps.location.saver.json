        "comment": "Using my Nexus 4 with T-Mobile. This app was not picking up a GPS signal even after performing a force stop. I had to turn off my GPS completely then start it back up so the phone would run a quick check for a signal, that time this app finally picked it up. There needs to be a refresh command or this app needs to activity search for a signal when you start it up. Very frustrating.",

Since it was a Free app with hardly any reviews, I just downloaded it but didn\\'t expect much from it but boy was I wrong!   I got a 3hr 18m recording in an area without any mobile reception and in 1 click exported the KML file to my laptop to track the route.   I have to hand it to the devs, would\\'ve paid ANYTHING for this app. Fantastic work. Thank you so much!",
