    "description": "This is a simple app to display the time the CPU spends in each frequency state. This can be a useful tool in diagnosing battery problems or tweaking your overclock settings. It also displays the current kernel information and some other CPU informations. The app is a massive upgrade of Brandon Valosek's version with a bunch of new features.New Features:[*] For devices non compatible: deep sleep info available[*] Swipe gestures: horizontal swipe to show the most used settings[*] Now compatibility with the device can be tested: \"App Test\" menu item[*] Ability to reset/restore the timers when the cable is unplugged/plugged. thereshold customizable[*] Added infos about battery juice lost since last reset.[*] You can group togheter all the stats which percentage of use is under a customizable thereshold of.[*] Lots of UI changes:\t- Swipe gestures: horizontal swipe to show the most used settings\t- 2nd UI layout with buttons for the most used action(start/stop timer, refresh, hide states)\t- infos on both partial and total time\t- timer info: initial battery level and juice lost\t- expandible content in main UI layout\t- row in the graph for all the grouped freqs\t- \"Deep Sleep\" can be showen/hidden [*] \"Cpu Files\" menu item to see the content of the files: affected_cups and time_in_state.[*] UI sounds[*] \"Setting\" menu to maximize the customization experience[*] Available language: english, italian, german, chinese (simplified and traditional)[*] \"Idles states\" informations with timers[*] and more...### PROBLEMS, BUGS, REPORTS ##If you are having issues with this app, please contact me at cpuspy.realgpp@gmail.com! With the comments left in the Market there is no way I can really understand what the problem is and how to fix it.If you are experiencing some problem and you would like to get rid of it, you can enable the verbose option from Settings so that the app will generate a logfile of all the operation it does. Then, when a problem happens, you can send me at cpuspy.realgpp@gmail.com the \"CpuSpy.log\" file stored in the mass storage that contains much more informations than the default android error report procedure. This way it will be easier and faster to solve the bug for me :)!!!!!! IMPORTANT NOTE !!!!!!If you see the message \"No states found\" when the app starts it means the app can't read the file /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/cpufreq/stats/time_in_state. This IS NOT an app related error. The solutions to the problem is to contact your ROM/kernel developer and let him know about this problem.!!!!!! NON ROOTED DEVICES !!!!!!To have a rooted devices it's not mandatory but however depends by the kernel of the ROM. For example tha app works on Galaxy S3 and Galaxy Ace, both of them on their stock ROMSPermissions explained:android.permission.RECEIVE_BOOT_COMPLETED: to delete the some internal variables on each reboot.android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE: used to write log messages to the file CpuSpy.log (if verbose option is enabled)android.permission.BATTERY_STATS: only to READ the battery juice lost when timer is setandroid.permission.INTERNET and android.permission.ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE are used only for the ad banners###### DONATION ###### If you LIKE my work and you think I should keep updating the app with new features, take in consideration to buy the DONATE version of the app like a little reward for my  development efforts.I can't get enough of stress this out. Some user's complaining the app doesn't work for some reason but if you don't send me any reports how can I get a clue of the problem? And most of all, how I can fix it? I'm not Patrick Jane ;)### PROBLEMS, BUGS, REPORTS ##If you are having issues with this app, please contact me at cpuspy.realgpp@gmail.com!",
