    "description": "TileStorm is here for Android so you can find out for yourself why this game was a hit on iPhone and has been compared to Angry Birds for it's huge amount addictive and challenging gameplay.** Please note not all pieces can be moved, or may be constrained by other pieces. That is part of the puzzle and is by design. Look for the visual cues to indicate whether a given piece is movable or it will only move along with other pieces. **This Lite version gives you the chance to get a feel for the 100 unique puzzles and 10's of hours of gameplay that await you in the full version to tax your mental agility and lateral thinking. More fun than brain training with guaranteed satisfaction as you travel across four environments beautifully detailed in full 3D. The aim of TileStorm is to solve a series of puzzles enabling 'Eggbot' the robot to make his way through each respective level to the exit. The first puzzles are very similar in appearance and strategy to traditional sliding puzzle games, but later in TileStorm players will encounter tiles with completely different properties, maps with multiple solutions, and levels requiring the re-use of certain tiles. Not all tiles can be moved and some can only be moved in certain directions - look for the visual clues to help you solve the puzzle. As you play through TileStorm you will find that TileStorm is much more than just a sliding tile game and strategies required in many other games will be needed to complete this game. TileStorm is guaranteed to present a challenge to anyone that plays it and it will require real skill and mental dexterity to complete. Please email us with questions or feedback.

        "comment": "It is wise to play the demo as it becomes immediately apparent why you should avoid buying the full game. Controls are unresponsive to touch. The graphics are dated and textures are low res. To make matters worse, the frame rate frequently stutters even on a dual core tablet. If you are looking for a good sliding puzzle game look no further than Cogs; a far better and more slickly presented game with more challenge, depth and replay value.",
