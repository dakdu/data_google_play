Sharpen your child's Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, and Division skills with flash card style questions.Fun sounds keep the task of learning math facts fresh for children.  Speed statistics are captured and can be viewed to measure progress.  Preference controls can be used to limit the questions to just what you need to focus on.  Want only subtraction, you can set it up to only ask subtraction questions.  Preparing for a multiplication test on 7's, you can set that up as well.  Having problems with 9x6 specifically, a test pattern is used to focus on that specific question.  Want to just be tested on question you've missed, set it up for that.  Multiple user support saves per-user preferences and statistics.  Easter Eggs are hidden in the game as a fun surprise or a challenge to those up to the task.

        "comment": "This app would be truly wonderful if the multiplication and division facts went up to 15x15. Including the squares and cubes would be awesome, too. I really like how I can customize the problem sets for my different children and track their progress. Please add the math facts through 15x15!",
