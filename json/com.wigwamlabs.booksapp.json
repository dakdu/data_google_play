    "description": "BooksApp helps you organize your home library effortlessly. Scan the barcode of a book and all its information is downloaded from the web and saved to your phone automaticallyÂ¹. You can then easily keep track of your books.To lend a book to someone, scan it (or open it from the list), press \"Lend book\" and select your friend. When a month has passed, you will get a notification to remind you where the book is. If you have a book you want to recommend to a friend, you can do that over SMS, e-mail or Facebook etc.You can organize your books into collections, e.g. \"Favorites\", \"Reading now\" or whatever tickles your fancy.Finding more books is trivial. You can search for books by the same author or publisher, or books dealing with the same subject, all without typing a single character. Saving any of the matches to your phone is just one tap away.You can export books in two ways, either as a spreadsheetâwhich you can send to anyoneâor to Google DocsÂ². The spreadsheet is a CSV (Comma-separated values) file that you can open in any spreadsheet program. You can also send the file to other BooksApp users, both Android and iPhone users.Importing books is done by opening a CSV file from an e-mail or from the file manager.BooksApp exists for iPhone as well, see www.books-app.com for more information.Happy book organization! :-)BooksApp is open source and released under the Apache 2.0 Licensehttps://github.com/jonasb/BooksAppÂ¹) Should the book not exist amongst Google Books vast amounts of books, you can always enter it manually.Â²) Google Docs export requires Android 2.1 or later.",

As a elementary teacher, I have a lot of my personal books mixed in with the classroom library and this app makes it easier to track where and who has what.   The only downside is that the app doesn\\'t have a way to track multiple copies.  If this feature could be added, it would be perfect!",

This app crashed as soon as I tried to scan my first barcode.  I opened it again and tried to scan again and it crashed again.  Amazingly upon the next open, the book was listed in the \\\"Books\\\" section.  However, I cannot figure out how to add it to a list like \\\"To Read\\\" or \\\"Have Read\\\" which seems like a natural next step once it is in the library.  I think I have to scan it again to add to that list.  I\\'m not sure.  Anyway, the app seems cumbersome and buggy based on my initial use, so I\\'m giving it up and looking for something else.",
