    "description": "Cashflow is an easy to use basic checkbook register.  Using this application as a personal account ledger will allow users to track running, ending, and current balances for multiple accounts.  This is a very useful tool for users that wish to project their cash flow by entering future transactions into their register.This application is perfect for users that want to get rid of their manual checkbook register.  Unlike other applications on the market, this application sends no personal data over the internet.  No account numbers, user names, or passwords are required for use.  All information is stored on your phone.Cashflow allows users to specify a variety of account types that can be used to filter the account list to only show a subset of the accounts being tracked.  Users may also enter scheduled transactions that can be set to appear automatically in the register on an interval, or specific day of the month.  Users that keep a register for multiple accounts will appreciate the ability to enter a single transfer transaction that will enter a corresponding transaction automatically into the account specified to transfer money to/from.  Users preferring a different look can change the appearance of the application to display black letters on a white background as opposed to the default white on black style.Cashflow offers several features that make it valuable to users outside of the United States.  User s can add their own currencies and associate each account with a different currency.  Likewise, users have the ability to change the format for how dates are displayed within the app.  Dates can be displayed as M/D/Y, D/M/Y, or Y/M/D.Cashflow also offers users the ability to backup their data to a SD card, as well as the ability to email that file off of the device for safekeeping should the phone be lost, damaged, or reset.Paid users are provided with several exclusive features; * No advertisements* Home screen widget* Password protection* Ability to search transactions* Ability to export transactions to a CSV file* No usage tracking**Note**Password protection is enabled by either fully exiting the application by pressing the back key, or after five minutes of inactivity.A full change log is available both on our website and inside the app.  If you have any problems or feedback, please email us so that we can address your issue.  We appreciate comments and feedback left on our app, but Google does not offer us a sufficient means to respond to those comments.  If you need assistance, please contact us at at this email address:  support@ndl.cc",

        "comment": "This app did precisely what I needed at the time I downloaded it. However, I later found myself needing to delete an account because I added an account that I forgot had already been added. First, the duplication was not noticed by the app; second, there doesn\\'t seem to be a delete function on the app at all.  That\\'s a shame. I test the free versions before I buy - that\\'s kind of the point of the free version. If it does what I need, I buy it. Since nowhere in the text about the paid version mentions anything about deleting accounts or even checking for duplications, I won\\'t buy the paid app.  That\\'s a shame. I\\'ll be road-testing another app.  EDIT: I have sent my above concern to NDL. Will responded quickly and described the process for deleting an account, quoted:  \\\"You can delete an account from the accounts list by pressing and holding on the account in question until the menu pops up.  Select delete from there.  Be aware that any transactions in other accounts that are transfers to or from that account may show up differently and not reflect the description \\\"transfer to/from <account name>\\\" as that account will no longer exist.\\\"  Rating changed from 3 to 4 stars.",

        "comment": "I recently got a new phone and had to re-install all my apps.  I was using a different app for a register but couldn\\'t remember the name so I tried out a few others.  I barely kept this for 10 minutes before uninstalling it and searching for my old app.  Things I didn\\'t like here -  1.) To enter a dollar amount, I have to select the keypad button to see the numeric keypad.  This should come up automatically so I don\\'t have to select it.  It\\'s faster to enter numbers this way but takes more time when I have to select the keypad button w/ every transaction.  2.) The category for transactions.  I have to select the payor, then select the category each time. It would be a big time saver if I selected the payor and it recalled the category from the last time I used that payor.  3.) Clearing a transaction - don\\'t make it a dropdown list.  Just give me a radio button to select it\\'s cleared or not.  The dropdown list takes longer to select.  I can\\'t say anything else about other features such as reports as it was taking longer to enter the transactions than my other app and I didn\\'t want to go any further w/ this app.",
