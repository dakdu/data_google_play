Parents can feel comfortable that their child will not make calls, open other apps, or delete things. Includes save and open features so kids doodles / drawings can be saved and edited.The multi-touch is enabled on this app which makes it more fun for kids and lets them keep drawing even if they accidentally are touching the screen with the hand holding the device. (Note: the multi-touch is flaky on some devices, this has to do with bugs in the API) Features:â Toddler/child lock.â Easy to use design for young children.â Toddler mode with sounds and random colors/effectsâ Save kids doodles and sketches.â Multi-touch enabled so accidental touches don't keep. child from being able to draw. â Lock works on Ice Cream Sandwich.â Coloring book drawings(NOTE: Free version WILL open browser or go to android market if an ad is clicked. Only one ad will be shown per session. Get Toddler Paint Pro for full locking feature.)This App IS NOT a virus!
