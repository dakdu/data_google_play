        "comment": "I suppose this is ok if you don\\'t expect much. This app is rigid in its inputs and wasn\\'t able to align with my training plan\\'s date. I picked Sunday off and the plan said I was to be off Thursday. I enter my age for calculated heart rate and it didn\\'t calculate until I left the screen and returned. I entered more yards for my swim workout and it didn\\'t save. Add something before trying to charge for this garbage.",
