I often browse through the recipes on my phone when I am waiting around at appointments. This app is a must have for anyone who loves to cook.  The downside is....recipes that I have clipped, it does not show the whole recipe. I tried to follow a recipe I clipped tonight and it showed only the steps and not the ingredients list. This is a huge problem and very frustrating.",
